Without music, life would be a mistake
It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you
It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness
You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist
Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you
You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star
In heaven, all the interesting people are missing
Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed
We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once
There are no facts, only interpretations
The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends
I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time
He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how
When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago
The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die. As well the minds which are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be mind
In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule
The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time
Man is the cruelest animal
The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently
I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance
Is man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of man?
Faith: not wanting to know what the truth is
Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood
Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings -- always darker, emptier and simpler
A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything
What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine
The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets through many a dark night
The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly
There are no beautiful surfaces without a terrible depth
A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all
Be careful, lest in casting out your demon you exorcise the best thing in you
We have art in order not to die of the truth
A good writer possesses not only his own spirit but also the spirit of his friends
There are two different types of people in the world, those who want to know, and those who want to believe
One ought to hold on to one's heart; for if one lets it go, one soon loses control of the head too
In truth,there was only one christian and he died on the cross
All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking
Ah, women. They make the highs higher and the lows more frequent
All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth
I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses
That which is done out of love is always beyond good and evil
Art is the proper task of life
All I need is a sheet of paper and something to write with, and then I can turn the world upside down
Meaning and morality of One's life come from within oneself. Healthy, strong individuals seek self expansion by experimenting and by living dangerously. Life consists of an infinite number of possibilities and the healthy person explores as many of them as posible. Religions that teach pity, self-contempt, humility, self-restraint and guilt are incorrect. The good life is ever changing, challenging, devoid of regret, intense, creative and risky
What does your conscience say? - 'You should become the person you are'
There is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings
You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?
Amor Fati -Love Your Fate, which is in fact your life
Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs; he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter
Silence is worse; all truths that are kept silent become poisonous
Doubt as sin. - Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason, by a miracle, and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements: even a glance towards land, even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming, even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature - is sin! And notice that all this means that the foundation of belief and all reflection on its origin is likewise excluded as sinful. What is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned
Invisible threads are the strongest ties
Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders
Stupidity in a woman is unfeminine
After coming into contact with a religious man I always feel I must wash my hands
He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying
A thought, even a possibility, can shatter and transform us
The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters
Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar
The visionary lies to himself, the liar only to others
They muddy the water, to make it seem deep
To predict the behavior of ordinary people in advance, you only have to assume that they will always try to escape a disagreeable situation with the smallest possible expenditure of intelligence
Ultimately, it is the desire, not the desired, that we love
The most perfidious way of harming a cause consists of defending it deliberately with faulty arguments
Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves?
Become who you are!
One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star
Is it better to out-monster the monster or to be quietly devoured?
I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible
Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?
The voice of beauty speaks softly; it creeps only into the most fully awakened souls
Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen
Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man
Remorse.-- Never yield to remorse, but at once tell yourself: remorse would simply mean adding to the first act of stupidity a second
There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy
Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you
Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful
One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil
True, we love life, not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness
Whenever I climb I am followed by a dog called 'Ego'
Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage
Love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not
One must give value to their existence by behaving as if ones very existence were a work of art
If you know the why, you can live any how
There are no eternal facts, as there are no absolute truths
My dear friend, what is this our life? A boat that swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain about it is that one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been faithful neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from "capsizing"! Let us then continue our voyage-each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun-what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather!
For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity or perception to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication
Nothing on earth consumes a man more quickly than the passion of resentment
The irrationality of a thing is no argument against its existence, rather a condition of it
And once you are awake, you shall remain awake eternally
Only sick music makes money today
The worst readers are those who behave like plundering troops: they take away a few things they can use, dirty and confound the remainder, and revile the whole
At bottom every man knows well enough that he is a unique being, only once on this earth; and by no extraordinary chance will such a marvelously picturesque piece of diversity in unity as he is, ever be put together a second time
In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
Convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies
It is my ambition to say in ten sentences what others say in a whole book
What is the seal of liberation? Not to be ashamed in front of oneself
But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself; you lie in wait for yourself in caverns and forests. Lonely one, you are going the way to yourself! And your way goes past yourself, and past your seven devils! You will be a heretic to yourself and witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy one and villain. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame: how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?
There is an innocence in admiration: it occurs in one who has not yet realized that they might one day be admired
Man is something that shall be overcome.... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman -- a rope over an abyss... What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end
A subject for a great poet would be God's boredom after the seventh day of creation
One must pay dearly for immortality; one has to die several times while still alive
One must learn to love.- This is what happens to us in music: first one has to learn to hear a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it, to isolate it and delimit it as a separate life; then it requires some exertion and good will to tolerate it in spite of its strangeness, to be patient with its appearance and expression, and kindhearted about its oddity:-finally there comes a moment when we are used to it, when we wait for it, when we sense that we should miss it if it were missing: and now it continues to compel and enchant us relentlessly until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers who desire nothing better from the world than it and only it.- But that is what happens to us not only in music: that is how we have learned to love all things that we now love. In the end we are always rewarded for our good will, our patience, fairmindedness, and gentleness with what is strange; gradually, it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and indescribable beauty:-that is its thanks for our hospitality. Even those who love themselves will have learned it in this way: for there is no other way. Love, too, has to be learned
One must shed the bad taste of wanting to agree with many. "Good" is no longer good when one's neighbor mouths it. And how should there be a "common good"! The term contradicts itself: whatever can be common always has little value. In the end it must be as it is and always has been: great things remain for the great, abysses for the profound, nuances and shudders for the refined, and, in brief, all that is rare for the rare
No shepherd and one herd! Everybody wants the same, everybody is the same: whoever feels different goes voluntarily into a madhouse
Live dangerously
The author must keep his mouth shut when his work starts to speak
I am one thing, my writings are another
...throw roses into the abyss and say: 'here is my thanks to the monster who didn't succeed in swallowing me alive
To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering
The spiritualization of sensuality is called love: it is a great triumph over Christianity
The end of a melody is not its goal: but nonetheless, had the melody not reached its end it would not have reached its goal either. A parable
Love is blind.  Friendship closes its eyes
The earth has a skin and that skin has diseases; one of its diseases is called man
Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity
Plato was a bore
Without forgetting it is quite impossible to live at all
The Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad
Love brings to light a lover's noble and hidden qualities-his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive of his normal qualities
If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs
Madness is something rare in individuals - but in groups, parties, peoples, ages, it is the rule
All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks, in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity
You say, it's dark. And in truth, I did place a cloud before your sun. But do you not see how the edges of the cloud are already glowing and turning light
But it is the same with man as with the tree. The more he seeks to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthword, downword, into the dark, the deep - into evil
It is not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow, that the lover of knowledge is reluctant to step into its waters
Poets are shameless with their experiences: they exploit them
As long as you still experience the stars as something "above you", you lack the eye of knowledge
The desire to annoy no one, to harm no one, can equally well be the sign of a just as of an anxious disposition
Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen. Few in pursuit of the goal
What is the truth, but a lie agreed upon
That which does not  kill me, makes me stronger
I am too inquisitive, too skeptical, too arrogant, to let myself be satisfied with an obvious and crass solution of things. God is such an obvious and crass solution; a solution which is a sheer indelicacy to us thinkers - at bottom He is really nothing but a coarse commandment against us: ye shall not think!
It is impossible to suffer without making someone pay for it; every complaint already contains revenge
One must not let oneself be misled: they say 'Judge not!' but they send to Hell everything that stands in their way
Every true faith is infallible. It performs what the believing person hopes to find in it. But it does not offer the least support for the establishing of an objective truth. Here the ways of men divide. If you want to achieve peace of mind and happiness, have faith. If you want to be a disciple of truth, then search
A thought comes when it will, not when I will
It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men!
Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers. He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers--and spirit itself will stink. Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking. Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace. He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart. In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall. The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched. I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh
I hate who steals my solitude, without really offer me in exchange company
Truths are illlusions which we have forgotten are illusions
The life of the enemy . Whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemy's staying alive
He who has attained the freedom of reason to any extent cannot, for a long time, regard himself otherwise than as a wanderer on the face of the earth - and not even as a traveler towards a final goal, for there is no such thing. But he certainly wants to observe and keep his eyes open to whatever actually happens in the world; therefore he cannot attach his heart too firmly to anything individual; he must have in himself something wandering that takes pleasure in change and transitoriness
If we train our conscience, it kisses us while it hurts
The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge-a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest
We do not place especial value on the possession of a virtue until we notice its total absence in our opponent
Sensuality often hastens the "Growth of Love" so much that the roots remain weak and are easily torn up
Of all that is written I love only what a man has written in his own blood
He who possesseth little is so much the less possessed. Blessed be moderate poverty!
You look up when you wish to be exalted. And I look down because I am exalted
I obviously do everything to be "hard to understand" myself
The most spiritual human beings, assuming they are the most courageous, also experience by far the most painful tragedies: but it is precisely for this reason that they honor life, because it brings against them its most formidable weapons
Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman--a rope over an abyss.   A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.   What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal:  what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.   I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers.   I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore.   I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.   I love him who lives in order to know, and seeks to know in order that the Superman may hereafter live.  Thus seeks he his own down-going.   I love him who labors and invents, that he may build the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant:  for thus seeks he his own down-going.   I love him who loves his virtue:  for virtue is the will to down-going, and an arrow of longing.   I love him who reserves no share of spirit for himself, but wants to be wholly the spirit of his virtue:  thus walks he as spirit over the bridge.   I love him who makes his virtue his inclination and destiny:  thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.   I love him who desires not too many virtues.  One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one's destiny to cling to.   I love him whose soul is lavish, who wants no thanks and does not give back:  for he always bestows, and desires not to keep for himself.   I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favor, and who then asks:  "Am I a dishonest player?"--for he is willing to succumb.   I love him who scatters golden words in advance of his deeds, and always does more than he promises:  for he seeks his own down-going.   I love him who justifies the future ones, and redeems the past ones: for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.   I love him who chastens his God, because he loves his God:  for he must succumb through the wrath of his God.   I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through a small matter:  thus goes he willingly over the bridge.   I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgets himself, and all things that are in him:  thus all things become his down-going.   I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart:  thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causes his down-going.   I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowers over man:  they herald the coming of the lightning, and succumb as heralds.   Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:  the lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.--
The world is beautiful, but has a disease called man
Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my happiness on the wall
No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself
Admiration for a quality or an art can be so strong that it deters us from striving to possess it
A joke is an epigram on the death of a feeling
Be careful when you cast out your demons that you dont throw away the best of yourself
There is an old illusion. It is called good and evil
I change too quickly: my today refutes my yesterday. When I ascend I often jump over steps, and no step forgives me that
What is done out of Love is beyond Good and Evil
The pure soul is a pure lie
Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty
There will always be rocks in the road ahead of us. They will be stumbling blocks or stepping stones; it all depends on how you use them
Of all evil I deem you capable: Therefore I want good from you. Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws
You know these things as thoughts, but your thoughts are not your experiences, they are an echo and after-effect of your experiences: as when your room trembles whe na carriage goes past. I however am sitting in the carriage, and often I am the carriage itself. Ina man who thinks like this, the dichotomy between thinking and feeling, intellect and passion, has really disappeared. He feels his thoughts. He can fall in love with an idea. An idea can make him ill
Dancing in all its forms cannot be excluded from the curriculum of all noble education; dancing with the feet, with ideas, with words, and, need I add that one must also be able to dance with the pen?
He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies, real or imaginary
Love, too, has to be learned
To learn to see- to accustom the eye to calmness, to patience, and to allow things to come up to it; to defer judgment, and to acquire the habit of approaching and grasping an individual case from all sides. This is the first preparatory schooling of intellectuality. One must not respond immediately to a stimulus; one must acquire a command of the obstructing and isolating instincts
Family love is messy, clinging, and of an annoying and repetitive pattern, like bad wallpaper
Whoever, at any time, has undertaken to build a new heaven has found the strength for it in his own hell..
Giving style to ones character - a great and rare art! It is exercised by those who see all the strengths and weaknesses of their own natures and then comprehend them in an artistic plan until everything appears as art and reason and even weakness delights the eye
When you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you
The slow arrow of beauty. The most noble kind of beauty is that which does not carry us away suddenly, whose attacks are not violent or intoxicating (this kind easily awakens disgust), but rather the kind of beauty which infiltrates slowly, which we carry along with us almost unnoticed, and meet up with again in dreams; finally, after it has for a long time lain modestly in our heart, it takes complete possession of us, filling our eyes with tears, our hearts with longing. What do we long for when we see beauty? To be beautiful. We think much happiness must be connected with it. But that is an error
I love him who seeks to create over and beyond himself and thus perishes
In the mountains of truth, you never climb in vain
You say 'I' and you are proud of this word. But greater than this- although you will not believe in it - is your body and its great intelligence, which does not say 'I' but performs 'I'
One does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes just as surely not to be understood
To find everything profound - that is an inconvenient trait. It makes one strain one's eyes all the time, and in the end one finds more than one might have wished
A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies
Morality is the herd-instinct in the individual
My solitude doesnt depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company
You desire to LIVE "according to Nature"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power-how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference? To live-is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, "living according to Nature," means actually the same as "living according to life"-how could you do DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature "according to the Stoa," and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise-and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves-Stoicism is self-tyranny-Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima
I have learned to walk: since then I have run. I have learned to fly: since then I do not have to be pushed in order to move.  Now I am nimble, now I fly, now I see myself under myself, now a god dances within me
I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous - a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite
Success has always been a great liar
The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: âThis life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh  must return to you-all in the same succession and sequence-even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again-and you with it, speck of dust! Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: âYou are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine! If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, do you want this once more and innumerable times more? would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?
A moral system valid for all is basically immoral
A strong and well-constituted man digests his experiences (deeds and misdeeds all included) just as he digests his meats, even when he has some tough morsels to swallow
He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster . . . when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you
He who fights too long against dragons becomes a dragon himself; and if you gaze too long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze into you
Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching and anticipating other.  Virtue has come to consist of doing something in less time that someone else.  Hours in which honesty is permitted have become rare, and when they arrive one is tired and does not only want to "let oneself go" but actually wishes to stretch out as long and wide and ungainly as one happens to be...  Soon we may well reach the point where people can no longer give in to the desire for a vita contemplativa (that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends) without self-contempt and a bad conscience
They call you heartless; but you have a heart and I love you for being ashamed to show it
Anyone who has declared someone else to be an idiot, a bad apple, is annoyed when it turns out in the end that he isn't
Woman was Gods second mistake
Many a man fails as an original thinker simply because his memory is too good
Arrogance on the part of the meritorious is even more offensive to us than the arrogance of those without merit: for merit itself is offensive
In music the passions enjoy themselves
The vanity of others runs counter to our taste only when it runs counter to our vanity
One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure
Whoever thought that he had understood something of me had merely construed something out of me, after his own image
I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things:-then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:  let that be my love from henceforth!
They're so cold, these scholars! May lightning strike their food so that their mouths learn how to eat fire!
What if a demon were to creep after you one night, in your loneliest loneliness, and say, 'This life which you live must be lived by you once again and innumerable times more; and every pain and joy and thought and sigh must come again to you, all in the same sequence. The eternal hourglass will again and again be turned and you with it, dust of the dust!' Would you throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse that demon? Or would you answer, 'Never have I heard anything more divine'?
The real world is much smaller than the imaginary
Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by. They do not know what is meant by yesterday or today, they leap about, eat, rest, digest, leap about again, and so from morn till night and from day to day, fettered to the moment and its pleasure or displeasure, and thus neither melancholy nor bored. [...] A human being may well ask an animal: 'Why do you not speak to me of your happiness but only stand and gaze at me?' The animal would like to answer, and say, 'The reason is I always forget what I was going to say' - but then he forgot this answer too, and stayed silent
The real man wants two different things: danger and play. Therefore he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything
He who cannot put his thoughts on ice should not enter into the heat of dispute
As soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples
Anyone who fights with monsters should take care that he does not in the process become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
Blessed are the sleepy ones: for they shall soon fall off
Memory says, 'I did that.'  Pride replies, 'I could not have done that.'  Eventually, memory yields
This is the hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver
The overman...Who has organized the chaos of his passions, given style to his character, and become creative. Aware of life's terrors, he affirms life without resentment
One sticks to an opinion because he prides himself on having come to it on his own, and another because he has taken great pains to learn it and is proud to have grasped it: and so both do so out of vanity
I am not upset that you lied to me, I am upset that from now on I cannot believe you
He who despises himself esteems himself as a self-despiser
I love the great despisers because they are the great adorers..
Belief means not wanting to know what is true
At times one remains faithful to a cause only because its opponents do not cease to be insipid

No one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any
Everyone who has ever built anywhere a new heaven first found the power thereto in his own hell
Those you cannot teach to fly, teach to fall faster
The text has disappeared under the interpretation
What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions - they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force
The essence of all beautiful art, all great art, is gratitude
Because we have for millenia made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world, looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has acquired color - but we have been the colorists: it is the human intellect that has made appearances appear and transported its erroneous basic conceptions into things
One is fruitful only at the cost of being rich in contradictions
In the end things must be as they are and have always been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare
There are terrible people who, instead of solving a problem, bungle it and make it more difficult for all who come after. Whoever can't hit the nail on the head should, please, not hit at all
The greatest cure for love is still that time honoured medicine - love returned
What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure - as a mere automaton of duty?
Glance into the world just as though time were gone: and everything crooked will become straight to you
The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more you need to seduce the senses to it
One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired
How much truth can a spirit bear, how much truth can a spirit dare? ... that became for me more and more the real measure of value
He who obeys, does not listen to himself!
Every attainment, every step forward in knowledge, follows from courage, from hardness against oneself, from cleanliness in relation to oneself
Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology
That for which we find words is something already dead in our hearts
I consist of body and soul - in the worlds of a child. And why shouldn't we speak like children? But the enlightened, the knowledgealbe would say: I am body through and through, nothing more; and the soul is just a word for something on the body
Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of health..
Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion
In the end we are always rewarded for our good will, our patience, fair-mindedness, and gentleness with what is strange
Most people are far too much occupied with themselves to be malicious
Blessed are the forgetful; for they get over their stupidities, too
My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it-all idealism is mendaciousness in the face of what is necessary-but love it
To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying but an ancient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle [....]  Without cruelty there is no festival
And so, onwards... along a path of wisdom, with a hearty tread, a hearty confidence.. however you may be, be your own source of experience.  Throw off your discontent about your nature. Forgive yourself your own self.  You have it in your power to merge everything you have lived through- false starts, errors, delusions, passions, your loves and your hopes- into your goal, with nothing left over
Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer assured of our love after we have lived in it for three months, and some distant coast attracts our avarice: possessions are generally diminished by possession
One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly
Close beside my knowledge lies my black ignorance
The desire for a strong faith is not the proof of a strong faith, rather the opposite. If one has it one may permit oneself the beautiful luxury of skepticism: one is secure enough, fixed enough for it
I would only believe in a god who could dance
So long as men praise you, you can only be sure that you are not yet on your own true path but on someone else's
All truth is simple ... is that not doubly a lie?
But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful!
A bad conscience is easier to cope with than a bad reputation
Art is essentially the affirmation, the blessing, and the deification of existence
God is dead, but considering the state the species man is in, there will perhaps be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown
Every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is continually growing
Have you ever said Yes to a single joy?  O my friends, then you have said Yes too to all woe.  All things are entangled, ensnared, enamored; if ever you wanted one thing twice, if ever you said, "You please me, happiness!  Abide moment!" then you wanted all back.  All anew, all eternally, all entangled, ensnared, enamored--oh then you loved the world.  Eternal ones, love it eternally and evermore; and to woe too, you say:  go, but return!  For all joy wants--eternity
There is a certain right by which we many deprive a man of life, but none by which we may deprive him of death; this is mere cruelty
When one has not had a good father, one must create one
I am no man, I am dynamite
It is nobler to declare oneself wrong than to insist on being right --especially when one is right
Your only problem, perhaps, is that you scream without letting yourself cry
Untroubled, scornful, outrageous - that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior
One has to take a somewhat bold and dangerous line with this existence: especially as, whatever happens, we are bound to lose it
Freedom is the will to be responsible for ourselves
When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you
My formula for happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal
Virtue is under certain circumstances merely an honorable form of stupidity: who could be ill-disposed toward it on that account? And this kind of virtue has not been outlived even today. A kind of sturdy peasant simplicity, which, however, is possible in all classes and can be encountered only with respect and a smile, believes even today that everything is in good hands, namely in the "hands of God"; and when it maintains this proportion with the same modest certainty as it would that two and two make four, we others certainly refrain from contradicting. Why disturb THIS pure foolishness? Why darken it with our worries about man, people, goal, future? And even if we wanted to do it, we could not. They project their own honorable stupidity and goodness into the heart of things (the old God, deus myops, still lives among them!); we others - we read something else into the heart of things: our own enigmatic nature, our contradictions, our deeper, more painful, more mistrustful wisdom
To recognize untruth as a condition of life--that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil
Physiologists should think before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength--life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results
There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena
Being human is a complicated gig. So give that ol' dark night of the soul a hug. Howl the eternal yes!
I have forgotten my umbrella
The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously
Character is determined more by the lack of certain experiences than by those one has had
We would not let ourselves be burned to death for our opinions: we are not sure enough of them for that
Man is a rope, tied between beast and Superman--a rope over an abyss
Man's maturity: to have regained the seriousness that he had as a child at play
There they laugh: they do not understand me; I am not the mouth for these ears
I love those who do not know how to live, except by going under, for they are those who cross over
Morality is neither rational nor absolute nor natural. World has known many moral systems, each of which advances claims universality; all moral systems are therefore particular, serving a specific purpose for their propagators or creators, and enforcing a certain regime that disciplines human beings for social life by narrowing our perspectives and limiting our horizons
Watch them clamber, these swift monkeys! They clamber over one another and thus drag one another into the mud and the depth. They all want to get to the throne: that is their madness - as if happiness sat on the throne. Often, mud sits on the throne - and often the throne also on mud. Mad they all appear to me, clambering monkeys and overardent. Foul smells their idol, the cold monster: foul, they smell to me altogether, these idolators
Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, certainly, but degenerated to Vice
Every talent must unfold itself in fighting
In this sense the Dionysian man resembles Hamlet: both have once looked truly into the essence of things, they have gained knowledge, and nausea inhibits action; for their action could not change anything in the eternal nature of things; they feel it to be ridiculous or humiliating that they should be asked to set right a world that is out of joint.  Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion: that is the doctrine of Hamlet, not that cheap wisdom of Jack the Dreamer who reflects too much and, as it were, from an excess of possibilities does not get around to action.  Not reflection, no--true knowledge, an insight into the horrible truth, outweighs any motive for action, both in Hamlet and in the Dionysian man.  Now no comfort avails any more; longing transcends a world after death, even the gods; existence is negated along with its glittering reflection in the gods or in an immortal beyond.  Conscious of the truth he has once seen, man now sees everywhere only the horror or absurdity of existence; now he understands what is symbolic in Ophelia's fate; now he understands the wisdom of the sylvan god, Silenus: he is nauseated.  Here, when the danger to his will is greatest, art approaches as a saving sorceress, expert at healing.  She alone knows how to turn these nauseous thoughts about the horror or absurdity of existence into notions with which one can live: these are the sublime as the artistic taming of the horrible, and the comic as the artistic discharge of the nausea of absurdity.  The satyr chorus of the dithyramb is the saving deed of Greek art; faced with the intermediary world of these Dionysian companions, the feelings described here exhausted themselves
All credibility, all good conscience, all evidence of truth come only from the senses
Convictions are prisons
We ought to face our destiny with courage
It is a self-deception of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence
Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity. For the crowd believes that if it cannot see to the bottom of something it must be profound. It is so timid and dislikes going into the water
You tell me: 'Life is hard to bear.' But if it were otherwise why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening? Life is hard to bear: but do not pretend to be so tender! We are all of us pretty fine asses and asseses of burden!
The truth is ugly: we have art so as not to perish from the truth
Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who have little pride and no prospects of great conquests
The Great Man... is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without fear of 'opinion'; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and 'respectability,' and altogether everything that is the 'virtue of the herd.' If he cannot lead, he goes alone... He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar... When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame
Is man one of Gods blunders, or is God one of mans blunders?
We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life because it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself
The tree that would grow to heaven must send its roots to hell
Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality
Our faith in others betrays that we would rather have faith in ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer. And often with our love we want merely to overcome envy. And often we attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable
In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering among innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge
You say that a good cause will even sanctify war! I tell you, it is the good war that sanctifies every cause!
We talk so abstractly about poetry because all of us are usually bad poets
Women are considered deep - why? Because one can never discover any bottom to them. Women are not even shallow
Life is that which must overcome itself again and again
I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer
Go up close to your friend but do not go over to him! We should respect the enemy that is in our friend
Those moralists, on the other hand, who, following in the footsteps of Socrates, offer the individual a morality of self-control and temperance as a means to his own advantage, as his personal key to happiness, are the exceptions
Some men are born posthumously
There is not enough religion in the world to destroy the worlds religions
I can tell by my own reaction to it that this book is harmful." But let him only wait and perhaps one day he will admit to himself that this same book has done him a great service by bringing out the hidden sickness of his heart and making it visible.- Altered opinions do not alter a mans character (or do so very little); but they do illuminate individual aspects of the constellation of his personality which with a different constellation of opinions had hitherto remained dark and unrecognizable
It is not conflict of opinions that has made history so violent but conflict of belief in opinions, that is to say conflict of convictions
Worldly Wisdom  Do not stay in the field! Nor climb out of sight. The best view of the world Is from a medium height
Insanity in individuals is something rare- but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule
The one necessary thing.- A person must have one or the other. Either a cheerful disposition by nature, or a disposition made cheerful by art and knowledge
The lie is a condition of life
Oh great star! What would your happiness be if you did not have us to shine for?
If we possess a why of life we can put up with almost any how
Weariness that wants to reach the ultimate with one leap, with one fatal leap, a poor ignorant weariness that does not want to want any more: this created all gods and afterworlds
Christianity was from the beginning, essentially and fundamentally, life's nausea and disgust with life, merely concealed behind, masked by, dressed up as, faith in "another" or "better" life
Wanderer, who are you? I watch you go on your way, without scorn, without love, with impenetrable eyes - damp and downhearted, like a plumb line that returns unsatisfied from every depth back into the light (what was it looking for down there?), with a breast that does not sigh, with lips that hide their disgust, with a hand that only grips slowly: who are you? What have you done? Take a rest here, this spot is hospitable to everyone, - relax! And whoever you may be: what would you like now? What do you find relaxing? Just name it: I'll give you whatever I have! - "Relaxing? Relaxing? How inquisitive you are! What are you saying! But please, give me - -" What? What? Just say it! - "Another mask! A second mask!" ..
I hate you most because you attract, but are not strong enough to pull me to you
And if you are not a bird, then beware of coming to rest above an abyss
Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon absolute truth.... Through words and concepts we shall never reach beyond the wall off relations, to some sort of fabulous primal ground of things
Forgetfulness is not just a vis inertiae, as superficial people believe, but is rather an active ability to suppress, positive in the strongest sense of the word, to which we owe the fact that what we simply live through, experience, take in, no more enters our consciousness during digestion (one could call it spiritual ingestion) than does the thousand-fold process which takes place with our physical consumption of food, our so-called ingestion. To shut the doors and windows of consciousness for a while; not to be bothered by the noise and battle which our underworld of serviceable organs work with and against each other;a little peace, a little tabula rasa of consciousness to make room for something new, above all for the nobler  functions and functionaries, for ruling, predicting, predetermining (our organism runs along oligarchic lines, you see) - that, as I said, is the benefit of active forgetfulness, like a doorkeeper or guardian of mental order, rest and etiquette: from which can immediately see how there could be no happiness, cheerfulness, hope, pride, immediacy, without forgetfulness
Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away. Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I do-back to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning
It is a terrible thought, to contemplate that an immense number of mediocre thinkers are occupied with really influential matters
Not that you lied to me but that I no longer believe you has shaken me
No one dies of fatal truths nowadays: there are too many antidotes
I have never pondered over questions that are not questions
It was a subtle refinement of God to learn Greek when he wished to write a book  and that he did not learn it better
The noble soul reveres itself
No one can draw more out of things, books included, than he already knows.  A man has no ears for that to which experience has given him no access
Companions the creator seeks, not corpses, not herds and believers. Fellow creators the creator seeks -- those who write new values on new tablets. Companions the creator seeks, and fellow harvesters; for everything about him is ripe for the harvest
Well-meaning, helpful, good-natured attitudes of mind have not come to be honored on account of their usefulness, but because they are states of richer souls that are capable of bestowing and have their value in the feeling of the plenitude of life
Behind a remarkable scholar we not infrequently find an average human being, and behind an average artist we often find a very remarkable human being
God is a thought who makes crooked all that is straight
Against boredom even gods struggle in vain
A man far oftener appears to have a decided character from persistently following his temperament than from persistently following his principles
What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms  in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins
Though I may seem at times somewhat distant from you, through the gray mist of philology, I am never far, my thoughts always circle around you
You may lie with your mouth, but with the mouth you make as you do so you none the less tell the truth
If you are unwilling to endure your own suffering even for an hour, and ontinually forestall all possible misfortune, if you regard as deserving of annihilation, any suffering and pain generally as evil, as detestable, and as blots on existence, well, you have then, besides your religion of compassion, yet another religion in your heart (and this is perhaps the mother of the former)-the religion of smug ease. Ah, how little you know of the happiness of man, you comfortable and good-natured ones!for happiness and misfortune are brother and sister, and twins, who grow tall together, or, as with you, remain small together!
Ten truths must you find during the day; otherwise will you seek truth during the night, and your soul will have been hungry
Deeds need time, even after they are done, in order to be seen or heard
And do you know what the world is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by nothingness as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be empty here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms striving toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self- creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my beyond good and evil, without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself- do you want a name for this world? A solution for all of its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men?- This world is the will to power-and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power-and nothing besides!
The mother of excess is not joy but joylessness
What is happening to me happens to all fruits that grow ripe.  It is the honey in my veins that makes my blood thicker, and my soul quieter
Suppose a human being has thus put his ear, as it were, to the heart chamber of the world will and felt the roaring desire for existence pouring from there into all the veins of the world, as a thundering current or as the gentlest brook, dissolving into a mist-how could he fail to break suddenly? How could he endure to perceive the echo of innumerable shouts of pleasure and woe in the "wide space of the world night," enclosed in the wretched glass capsule of the human individual, without inexorably fleeing toward his primordial home, as he hears this shepherd's dance of metaphysics? But if such a work could nevertheless be perceived as a whole, without denial of individual existence; if such a creation could be created without smashing its creator-whence do we take the solution of such a contradiction?
On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow. -
The complete irresponsibility of man for his actions and his nature is the bitterest drop which he who understands must swallow
When man does not have firm, calm lines on the horizon of his life- mountain and forest lines, as it were- then a man's innermost will becomes agitated, preoccupied, and wistful
For truth to tell, dancing in all its forms cannot be excluded from the curriculum of all noble education: dancing with the feet, with ideas, with words, and, need I add that one must also be able to dance with pen- that one must learn how to write
And we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh
What was silent in the father speaks in the son, and often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father
The maturity of man-that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play
Man is the cruelest animal," says Zarathustra. "When gazing at tragedies, bull-fights, crucifixations he hath hitherto felt happier than at any other time on Earth. And when he invented Hell...lo, Hell was his Heaven on Earth"; he could put up with suffering now, by contemplating the eternal punishment of his oppressors in the other world
Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life. The living being is only a species of the dead, and a very rare species
My genius is in my nostrils
The word "Christianity" is already a misunderstanding; in reality there has been only one Christian, and he died on the cross
Thus the man who is responsive to artistic stimuli reacts to the reality of dreams as does the philosopher to the reality of existence; he observes closely, and he enjoys his observation: for it is out of these images that he interprets life, out of these processes that he trains himself for life
No artist tolerates reality
There is something quite amazing and monstrous about the education of upper-class women. What could be more paradoxical? All the world is agreed that they are to be brought up as ignorant as possible of erotic matters, and that one has to imbue their souls with a profound sense of shame in such matters until the merest suggestion of such things triggers the most extreme impatience and flight. The "honor" of women really comes into play only here: what else would one not forgive them? But here they are supposed to remain ignorant even in their hearts: they are supposed to have neither eyes nor ears, nor words, nor thoughts for this -- their "evil;" and mere knowledge is considered evil. And then to be hurled as by a gruesome lightning bolt, into reality and knowledge, by marriage -- precisely by the man they love and esteem most! To catch love and shame in a contradiction and to be forced to experience at the same time delight, surrender, duty, pity, terror, and who knows what else, in the face of the unexpected neighborliness of god and beast! Thus a psychic knot has been tied that may have no equal. Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest student of humanity is inadequate for guessing how this or that woman manages to accommodate herself to this solution of the riddle, and to the riddle of a solution, and what dreadful, far-reaching suspicions must stir in her poor, unhinged soul -- and how the ultimate philosophy and skepsis of woman casts anchor at this point! Afterward, the same deep silence as before. Often a silence directed at herself, too. She closes her eyes to herself. Young women try hard to appear superficial and thoughtless. The most refined simulate a kind of impertinence. Women easily experience their husbands as a question mark concerning their honor, and their children as an apology or atonement. They need children and wish for them in a way that is altogether different from that in which a man may wish for children. In sum, one cannot be too kind about women
Did you ever say yes to a pleasure? oh my friends, then you also said yes to all pain. all things are linked, entwined, in love with one another
What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself. What is bad? All that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome
Supposing truth is a woman -- what then?
I fear you close by; I love you far away
Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of health; everything unconditional belongs in pathology
Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me
Good writers have two things in common: they prefer to be understood rather than admired; and they do not write for knowing and over-acute readers
I fear that, with our current veneration for the natural and the real, we have arrived at the opposite pole to all idealism, and have landed in the region of the waxworks
My humanity is a constant self-overcoming
The person who fights monsters should make sure that in the process, he does not become a monster himself. Because when you stare down at an abyss, the abyss stares back at you
A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at five or six great men- yes, and then to get around them
Your educators can only be your liberators
Try for once to justify the meaning of your existence as it were a posteriori by setting yourself an aim, a goal... an exalted and noble 'to this end.' Perish in pursuit of this and only this
It may be that until now there has been no more potent means for beautifying man himself than piety: it can turn man into so much art, surface, play of colors, graciousness that his sight no longer makes one suffer.---
Language as putative science. -   The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took  to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it.  To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world.  The sculptor of language was not so modest as to believe that he was only giving things designations, he conceived rather that with words he was expressing supreame knowledge of things; language is, in fact, the first stage of occupation with science.  Here, too, it is the belief that the truth has been found out of which the mightiest sources of energy have flowed.  A great deal later - only now - it dawns on men that in their belief in language they have propagated a tremendous error.  Happily, it is too late for the evolution of reason, which depends on this belief, to be put back.  - Logic too depends on presuppositions with which nothing in the real world corresponds, for example on the presupposition that there are identical things, that the same thing is identical at different points of time: but this science came into existence through the opposite belief (that such conditions do obtain in the real world).  It is the same with mathematics, which would certainly not have come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no real circle, no absolute magnitude
Was that life? Well then, once more!
Perhaps I am even envious of Stendhal? He robbed me of the best atheist joke which precisely I could have made: 'God's only excuse is that he does not exist'...I myself have said somewhere: what hitherto been the greatest objection to existence? God..
Not every end is the goal. The end of a melody is not its goal, Â and yet if Â a melody has not Â reached its end, it has not reached its goal
It was the sick and decaying who despised the body and earth and invented the heavenly realm and the redemptive drops of blood: but they took even these sweet and gloomy poisons from body and earth. They wanted to escape their own misery, and the stars were too far for them
At a certain place in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, for example, he might feel that he is floating above the earth in a starry dome, with the dream of immortality in his heart; all the stars seem to glimmer around him, and the earth seems to sink ever deeper downwards
Do you want to go along with others? or go on ahead? or go off on your own?...you must know what  you want and that you want. Fourth question for the conscience
Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it from me. I wish to spread it and bestow it, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches
I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them. the will to a system is a lack of integrity
Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short a sum of human relations which have been subjected to poetic and rhetorical intensification, translation and decoration [ ]; truths are illusions of which we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have become worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigour [ ]. Yet we still do not know where the drive to truth comes from, for so far we have only heard about the obligation to be truthful which society imposes in order to exist"   from, "On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense"
No one is accountable for existing at all, or for being constituted as he is, or for living in the circumstances and surroundings in which he lives.  The fatality of his nature cannot be disentangled from the fatality of all that which has been and will be.  He is not the result of a special design, a will, a purpose; he is not the subject of an attempt to attain an 'ideal of man' or an 'ideal of happiness' or an 'ideal of morality'--it is absurd to want to hand over his nature to some purpose or other.  We invented the concept 'purpose': in reality purpose is lacking...One is necessary, one is a piece of fate, one belongs to the whole, one is in the whole--there exists nothing which could judge, measure, compare, condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, condemn the whole..
Art is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside thereof for its conquest
Which is it? Is man only a blunder of God? Or is God only a blunder of man?
Fanatics are picturesque, mankind would rather see gestures than listen to reasons
The wreckage of stars - I built a world from this wreckage
Existence really is an imperfect tense that never becomes a present
Every habit makes our hand more witty, and out wit more handy
I want to speak to the despisers of the body. I would not have them learn and teach differently, but merely say farewell to their own bodies-- and thus become silent
We laugh at a man who, stepping out of his room at the very minute when the sun is rising, says, It is my will that the sun shall rise; or at him who, unable to stop a wheel, says, I wish it to roll; or, again, at him who, thrown in a wrestling match, says, Here I lie, but here I wish to lie. But, joking apart, do we not act like one of these three persons whenever we use the expression I wish?
How much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it dare?
Happiness is the feeling that power increases - that resistance is being overcome
Success has always been the greatest liar - and the "work" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer is disguised by his creations, often beyond recognition; the "work," whether of the artist or the philosopher, invents the man who has created it, who is supposed to have create it; "great men," as they are venerated, are subsequent pieces of wretched minor fiction
He who speaks a bit of a foreign language has more delight in it than he who speaks it well; pleasure goes along with superficial knowledge
And if a friend does you wrong, then say:  "I forgive you what you have done to me; that you have done it to YOURSELF, however--how could I forgive that!
The secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to live dangerously!  Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships out into uncharted seas!  Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves!  Be robbers and ravagers as soon as you ca not be rulers and owners, you men of knowledge!  The time will soon past when you could be content to live concealed int he woods like timid deer!
Joyous distrust is a sign of health. Everything absolute belongs to pathology
How lovely it is that there are words and sounds. Are not words and sounds rainbows and illusive bridges between things which are eternally apart?
As though "the Truth" were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors!
Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of humanity
However modest one may be in one's demand for intellectual cleanliness, one cannot help feeling, when coming into contact with the New Testament, a kind of inexpressible discomfiture: for the unchecked impudence with which the least qualified want to raise their voice on the greatest problems, and even claim to be judges of things, surpasses all measure. The shameless levity with which the most intractable problems (life, world, God, purpose of life) are spoken of, as if they were not problems at all but simply things that these little bigots KNEW!
Altered opinions do not alter a mans character (or do so very little); but they do illuminate individual aspects of the constellation of his personality which with a different constellation of opinions had hitherto remained dark and unrecognizable
Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely-a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some "thou shalt." Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only "strength of the will" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant- which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes "a believer."  Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of "freedom of the will" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called "the superstition of free will" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence
The consequences of our actions take hold of us, quite indifferent to our claim that meanwhile we have 'improved
My conception of freedom. - The value of a thing sometimes does not lie in that which one attains by it, but in what one pays for it - what it costs us. Liberal institutions cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than liberal institutions
What else is love but understanding and rejoicing in the fact that another person lives  acts  and experiences otherwise than we do?
Here the ways of men divide. If you wish to strive for peace of soul and happiness, then believe; if you wish to be a disciple of truth, then inquire
That for which we find words is something already dead in our hearts. There is always a kind of contempt in the act of speaking
Read from a distant star, the majuscule script of our earthly existence would perhaps lead to the conclusion that the earth was the distinctively ascetic planet, a nook of disgruntled, arrogant creatures filled with a profound disgust with themselves, at the earth, at all life, who inflict as much pain on themselves as they possibly can out of pleasure in inflicting pain which is probably their only pleasure
Are you one who looks on? or lends a hand? - or who looks away, sidles off?...Third question for the conscience
Only great pain, the long, slow pain that takes its time... compels us to descend to our ultimate depths... I doubt that such pain makes us "better"; but I know it makes us more profound... In the end, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe sickness, one returns newborn, having shed one's skin... with merrier senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, more childlike and yet a hundred times subtler than one has ever been before
From which stars have we fallen to meet each other here?
The believer in magic and miracles reflects on how to impose a law on nature--: and, in brief, the religious cult is the outcome of this reflection
They would have to sing better songs for me to learn to have faith in their Redeemer; and his disciples would have to look more redeemed!
Every word is a prejudice
The happiness of man is: I will. The happiness of woman is: he wills. âBehold, just now the world became perfect!-thus thinks every woman when she obeys out of entire love. And women must obey and find a depth for her surface. Surface is the disposition of woman: a mobile, stormy film over shallow water. Mans disposition, however, is deep; his river roars in subterranean caves: woman feels his strength but does not comprehend it
Let old ones go. Dont be a memory-monger! Once you were youngâânow you are even younger
The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions, who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men---as well as his great moments of grand harmony---a rare accident even in us! A sort of planetary motion---
The higher man is distinguished from the lower by his fearlessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune
He who does not lie does not know what truth is
When one is young, one venerates and despises without that art of nuances which constitutes the best gain of life, and it is only fair that one has to pay dearly for having assaulted men and things in this manner with Yes and No.  Everything is arranged so that the worst of tastes, the taste for the unconditional, should be cruelly fooled and abused until a man learns to put a little art into his feelings and rather to risk trying even what is artificial - as the real artists of life do
Either one does not dream, or one does so interestingly. One should learn to spend one's waking life in the same way: not at all, or interestingly
It is the evening that questions thus from within me
You who fight with monsters ought to see to it that you do not become a monster yourself. And when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you
Sometimes it is harder to accede to a thing than it is to see its truth
To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities-I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not-that one endures
Love of one is a piece of barbarism: for it is practised at the expense of all others. Love of God likewise
When a hundred men stand together, each of them loses his mind and gets another one
Reason" in language - oh, what an old deceptive female she is! I am afraid we are not rid of God because we still have faith in grammar
To be incapable of taking one's enemies, one's accidents, even one's misdeeds seriously for very long-that is the sign of strong, full natures in whom there is an excess of the power to form, to mold, to recuperate and to forget (a good example of this in modem times is Mirabeau, who had no memory for insults and vile actions done him and was unable to forgive simply because he-forgot).  Such a man shakes off with a single shrug many vermin that eat deep into others; here alone genuine 'love of one's enemies' is possible-supposing it to be possible at all on earth.  How much reverence has a noble man for his enemies!-and such reverence is a bridge to love.-For he desires his enemy for himself, as his mark of distinction; he can endure no other enemy than one in whom there is nothing to despise and very much to honor!  In contrast to this, picture 'the enemy' as the man of ressentiment conceives him-and here precisely is his deed, his creation: he has conceived 'the evil enemy,' 'the Evil One,' and this in fact is his basic concept, from which he then evolves, as an afterthought and pendant, a 'good one'-himself!
What? A great man? I only ever see the ape of his own ideal
One has to know the size of one's stomach
You should seek your enemy, you should wage your war - a war for your opinions. And when your opinion is defeatedy our honesty should still cry triumph over that!
Let us face ourselves. We are Hyperboreans; we know very well how far off we live. 'Neither by land nor by sea will you find the way to the Hyperboreans'-Pindar already knew this about us. Beyond the north, ice, and death-our life, our happiness. We have discovered happiness, we know the way, we have found the exit out of the labyrinth of thousands of years. Who else has found it? Modern man perhaps? 'I have got lost; I am everything that has got lost,' sighs modern man. This modernity was our sickness: lazy peace, cowardly compromise, the whole virtuous uncleanliness of the modern Yes and No.   Rather live in the ice than among modern virtues and other south winds! We were intrepid enough, we spared neither ourselves nor others; but for a long time we did not know where to turn with our intrepidity. We became gloomy, we were called fatalists. Our fatum-abundance, tension, the damming of strength. We thirsted for lightning and deeds and were most remote from the happiness of the weakling, 'resignation.' In our atmosphere was a thunderstorm; the nature we are became dark-for we saw no way. Formula for our happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal
When we have to change our mind about a person, we hold the inconvenience he causes us very much against him
Human life is inexplicable, and still without meaning: a fool may decide its fate
Often they descended to their grave with an ironic smile  for what was there left of them to bury! Only the dross, refuse, vanity, animality that had always weighed them down and that was now consigned to oblivion after having for long been the object of their contempt. But one thing will live, the monogram of their most essential being, a work, an act, a piece of rare enlightenment, a creation: it will live because posterity cannot do without it. In this transfigured form, fame is something more than the tastiest morsel of our egoism, as Schopenhauer called it: it is the belief in the solidarity and continuity of the greatness of all ages and a protest against the passing away of generations and the transitoriness of things
I go into solitude so as not to drink out of everybody's cistern. When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think I really think. After a time it always seems as if they want to banish my self from myself and rob me of my soul
It takes chaos to give birth to a dancing star
If we affirm one moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence. For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event - and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed
Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves
If a person wishes to achieve peace of mind and happiness then they should acquire faith, but if they want to be a disciple of truth, which can be "frightening and ugly, then they need to search
A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love
The most common sort of lie is that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a relatively rare offense
To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them
Not he is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state of mind
The bite of conscience is indecent
The free spirit again draws near to life - slowly, to be sure, almost reluctantly, almost mistrustfully. It again grows warmer about him, yellower as it were; feeling and feeling for others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kind blow across him. It seems to him as if his eyes are only now open to what is close at hand. he is astonished and sits silent: where had he been? These close and closest things: how changed they seem! what bloom and magic they have acquired!   He looks back gratefully - grateful to his wandering, to his hardness and self-alienation, to his viewing of far distances and bird-like flights in cold heights. What a good thing he had not always stayed "at home," stayed "under his own roof" like a delicate apathetic loafer! He had been -beside himself-: no doubt about that.   Only now does he see himself - and what surprises he experiences as he does so! What unprecedented shudders! What happiness even in the weariness, the old sickness, the relapses of the convalescent! How he loves to sit sadly still, to spin out patience, to lie in the sun! Who understands as he does the joy that comes in winter, the spots of sunlight on the wall!   They are the most grateful animals in the world, also the most modest, these convalescents and lizards again half-turned towards life: - there are some among them who allow no day to pass without hanging a little song of praise on the hem of its departing robe. And to speak seriously: to become sick in the manner of these free spirits, to remain sick for a long time and then, slowly, slowly, to become healthy, by which I mean "healthier," is a fundamental cure for all pessimism
Why go on clinging to this clod of earth, this way of life, why pay heed to what your neighbour says? It is so parochial to bind oneself to views which are no longer binding even a couple of hundred miles away. Orient and Occident are chalk-lines drawn before us to fool our timidity. I will make an attempt to attain freedom, the youthful soul says to itself; and is it to be hindered in this by the fact that two nations happen to hate and fight one another, or that two continents are separated by an ocean, or that all around it a religion is taught which, nevertheless, did not exist a few thousand years ago. All that is not you, it says to itself
Life is at an end where the kingdom of God begins
He who cannot obey himself will be commanded. That is the nature of living creatures
Ages of happiness. - An age of happiness is quite impossible, because men want only to desire it but not to have it, and every individual who experiences good times learns to downright pray for misery and disquietude.  The destiny of man is designed for happy moments - every life has them - but not for happy ages.  Nonetheless they will remain fixed in the imagination of man as 'the other side of the hill' because they have been inherited from ages past: for the concepts of the age of happiness was no doubt acquired in primeval times from that condition of which, after violent exertion in hunting and warfare, man gives himself up to repose, stretches his limbs and hears the pinions of sleep rustling about him.  It is a false conclusion if, in accordance with that ancient familiar experience, man imagines that, after whole ages of toil and deprivation, he can then partake of that condition of happiness correspondingly enhanced and protracted
Where has God gone? [the madman asked] I shall tell you.  We have killed him  you and I.  We are his murderers.  But how have we done this?  How were we able to drink up the seas?  Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon?  What did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now?  Whither are we moving now?  Away from all suns?  Are we not perpetually  falling?  Backwards, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there  any up or down left?  Are we not straying as though through Infinite nothing?  Where is God?  God is Dead.  Go remains dead.  And we have  killed him.  How shall we, murders of all murders, console ourselves?
What have we in common with the rosebud, which trembles because a drop of dew is lying upon it?
A friend should be a master at guessing and keeping still: you must not want to see everything
And as long as you are in any way ashamed before yourself, you do not yet belong with us
Books and drafts mean something quite different for different thinkers. One collects in a book the lights he was able to steal and carry home swiftly out of the rays of some insight that suddenly dawned on him, while another thinker offers us nothing but shadows - images in black and grey of what had built up in his soul the day before
I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: you have still chaos in you
I would not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a good dancer
Of what is great one must either be silent or speak with greatness. With greatness--that means cynically and with innocence
In his heart every man knows quite well that, being unique, he will be in the world only once and that no imaginable chance will for a second time gather together into a unity so strangely variegated an assortment as he is: he knows it but hides it like a bad conscience
Even when in the deepest distress, the actor ultimately cannot cease to think of the impression he and the whole scenic effect is making, even for example at the burial of his own child; he will weep over his own distress and the ways in which it expresses itself, as his own audience. The hypocrite who always plays one and the same role finally ceases to be a hypocrite; for example priests, who as young men are usually conscious or unconscious hypocrites, finally become natural and then really are priests without any affectation; or if the father fails to get that far then perhaps the son does so, employing his father's start and inheriting his habits. If someone obstinately and for a long time wants to appear something it is int he end hard for him to be anything else. The profession of almost every man, even that of the artist, begins with hypocrisy, with an imitation from without, with a copying of what is most effective. He who is always wearing a mask of a friendly countenance must finally acquire a power over benevolent moods without which the impression of friendliness cannot be obtained - and finally these acquire power over him, he is benevolent
God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him
The belly is the reason why man does not mistake himself for a god
All modern philosophizing is political, policed by governments, churches, academics, custom, fashion, and human cowardice, all off which limit it to a fake learnedness
Everything goes, everything comes back; eternally rolls the wheel of being. Everything dies, everything blossoms again; eternally runs the year of being. Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; eternally the same House of Being is built. Everything parts, everything greets every other thing again; eternally the ring of being remains faithful to itself. In every Now, being begins; round every Here rolls the sphere There. The center is everywhere. Bent is the path of eternity
Energy wasted on negative ends
Books that teach us to dance: There are writers who, by portraying the impossible as possible, and by speaking of morality and genius as if both were high-spirited freedom, as if man were rising up on tiptoe and simply had to dance out of inner pleasure
All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment
They devour each other and cannot even digest themselves
...inability to lie is still far from being love to truth. Be on your guard! ... He who cannot lie, doth not know what truth is
In loneliness, the lonely one eats himself; in a crowd, the many eat him. Now choose
The tragedy is that we cannot believe the dogmas of religion and metaphysics if we have the strict methods of truth in heart and head, but on the other hand, we have become through the development of humanity so tenderly suffering that we need the highest kind of means of salvation and consolation: whence arises the danger that man may bleed to death through the truth that he realises
It is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified
What do you plan to do in the land of the sleepers? You have been floating in a sea of solitude, and the sea has borne you up. At long last, are you ready for dry land? Are you ready to drag yourself ashore?
Socrates, the dialectical hero of the Platonic drama, reminds us of the kindred nature of the Euripidean hero who must defend his actions with arguments and counterarguments and in the process often risks the loss of our tragic pity; for who could mistake the optimistic element in the nature of the dialectic, which celebrates a triumph with every conclusion and can breathe only in cool clarity and consciousness
When one has much to put in them, a day has a thousand pockets
Nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value."  This unconditional will to truth-what is it? Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived? Or is it the will not to deceive? For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way, too-if only the special case "I do not want to deceive myself" is subsumed under the generalization "I do not want to deceive." But why not deceive?  But why not allow oneself to be deceived?  Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second. One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful, dangerous, calamitous to be deceived. In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a caution, a utility; but one could object in all fairness: How is that? Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less dangerous, less calamitous? What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally mistrustful or of the unconditionally trusting?
Human existence basically isââa never to be completed imperfect tense
Happiness: being able to forget or, to express in a more learned fashion
When we hear the ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves: Is it really possible! This, for a jew, crucified two thousand years ago, who said he was God's son? The proof of such a claim is lacking. Certainly the Christian religion is an antiquity projected into our times from remote prehistory; and the fact that the claim is believed - whereas one is otherwise so strict in examining pretensions - is perhaps the most ancient piece of this heritage. A god who begets children with a mortal woman; a sage who bids men work no more, have no more courts, but look for the signs of the impending end of the world; a justice that accepts the innocent as a vicarious sacrifice; someone who orders his disciples to drink his blood; prayers for miraculous interventions; sins perpetrated against a god, atoned for by a god; fear of a beyond to which death is the portal; the form of the cross as a symbol in a time that no longer knows the function and ignominy of the cross -- how ghoulishly all this touches us, as if from the tomb of a primeval past! Can one believe that such things are still believed?
We no longer have a sufficiently high estimate of ourselves when we communicate. Our true experiences are not garrulous. They could not communicate themselves if they wanted to: they lack words. We have already grown beyond whatever we have words for. In all talking there lies a grain of contempt. Speech, it seems, was devised only for the average medium, communicable. The speaker has already vulgarized himself by speaking
We can destroy only as creators
Man... cannot learn to forget, but hangs on the past: however far or fast he runs, that chain runs with him
People who have given us their complete confidence believe that they have a right to ours. The inference is false, a gift confers no rights
For nothing is more democratic than logic; it is no respecter of persons and makes no distinction between crooked and straight noses
Here the spirit becomes a lion who would conquer his freedom and be master   Who is the great dragon whom the spirit will no longer call lord and go? âThou shalt is the name of the great dragon.  But the spirit of the lion says, âI will
Indeed, at hearing the news that 'the old god is dead', we philosophers and 'free spirits' feel illuminated by a new dawn; our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, forebodings, expectation - finally the horizon seems clear again, even if not bright; finally our ships may set out again, set out to face any danger; every daring of the lover of knowledge is allowed again; the sea, our sea, lies open again; maybe there has never been such an 'open sea'
In letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God they glorify themselves
It is invisible hands that torment and bend us the worst
Wisdom-seems to the rabble a kind of escape, a means and a trick for getting well out of a wicked game. But the genuine philosopher-as it seems to us, my friends?-lives 'unphilosophically' and 'unwisely,' above all imprudently, and feels the burden and the duty of a hundred attempts and temptations of life-he risks himself constantly, he plays the wicked game
Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after they are done, before they can be seen and heard
We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge - and with good reason.  We have never sought ourselves - how could it happen that we should ever find ourselves?  It has rightly been said: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also"; our treasure is where the beehives of our knowledge are
The craving for equality can express itself either as a desire to pull everyone down to our own level (by belittling them, excluding them, tripping them up) or as a desire to raise ourselves up along with everyone else (by acknowledging them, helping them, and rejoicing in their success)
But in the loneliest desert happens the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becomes a lion; he will seize his freedom and be master in his own wilderness
As is well known, the priests are the most evil enemies-but why?  Because they are the most impotent.  It is because of their impotence that in them hatred grows to monstrous and uncanny proportions, to the most spiritual and poisonous kind of hatred.  The truly great haters in world history have always been priests; likewise the most ingenious haters: other kinds of spirit hardly come into consideration when compared with the spirit of priestly vengefulness
While the noble man lives in trust and openness with himself (gennaios 'of noble descent' underlines the nuance 'upright' and probably also 'naÃ¯ve'), the man of ressentiment is neither upright nor naive nor honest and straightforward with himself.  His soul squints; his spirit loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble.  A race of such men of ressentiment is bound to become eventually cleverer than any noble race; it will also honor cleverness to a far greater degree: namely, as a condition of existence of the first importance; while with noble men cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety-for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which noble souls have at all times recognized one another.  Ressentiment itself, if it should appear in the noble man, consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction, and therefore does not poison: on the other hand, it fails to appear at all on countless occasions on which it inevitably appears in the weak and impotent
What good is all this free-thinking, modernity, and turncoat flexibility if at some gut level you are still a Christian, a Catholic, and even a priest!
This woman is beautiful and clever: but how much cleverer she would have become if she were not beautiful!
There's no defense against stupidity
Dead are all gods: now we want the overman to live
This book belongs to the most rare of men. Perhaps not one of them is yet alive. First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men are born posthumously
It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of  namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown
In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge.  That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of "world history"- yet only a minute.  After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die
Truth as Circe. - Error has transformed animals into men; is truth perhaps capable of changing man back into an animal?
We say it is "explanation" but it is only in "description" that we are in advance of the older stages of knowledge and science. We describe better we explain just as little as our predecessors. We have discovered a manifold succession where the naive man and investigator of older cultures saw only two things "cause" and "effect " as it was said we have perfected the conception of becoming but have not got a knowledge of what is above and behind the conception. The series of "causes" stands before us much more complete in every case we conclude that this and that must first precede in order that that other may follow - but we have not grasped anything thereby. The peculiarity for example in every chemical process seems a "miracle " the same as before just like all locomotion nobody has "explained" impulse. How could we ever explain We operate only with things which do not exist with lines surfaces bodies atoms divisible times divisible spaces - how can explanation ever be possible when we first make everything a conception our conception It is sufficient to regard science as the exactest humanizing of things that is possible we always learn to describe ourselves more accurately by describing things and their successions. Cause and effect: there is probably never any such duality in fact there is a continuum before us from which we isolate a few portions - just as we always observe a motion as isolated points and therefore do not properly see it but infer it. The abruptness with which many effects take place leads us into error it is however only an abruptness for us. There is an infinite multitude of processes in that abrupt moment which escape us. An intellect which could see cause and effect as a continuum which could see the flux of events not according to our mode of perception as things arbitrarily separated and broken - would throw aside the conception of cause and effect and would deny all conditionality
A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I found in all things, that they prefer--to DANCE on the feet of chance
Everything in the world displeases me: but, above all, my displeasure in everything displeases me
When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us
But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants to be nowhere--until the whole body is decayed and withered by the petty infection... Thus spoke Zarathustra
One thing a man must have: either a naturally light disposition or a disposition lightened by art and knowledge
From the sun did I learn this, when it goeth down, the exuberant one: gold doth it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches, -So that the poorest fisherman roweth even with golden oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it. - Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sitteth he here and waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new tables half-written
The melancholy of everything completed!
A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am the people." It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life. Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them. Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs
Are you a slave? Then you cannot be a friend. Are you a tyrant? Then you cannot have friends
Their [philosophers] thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order
For believe me! - the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge! Soon the age will be past when you could be content to live hidden in forests like shy deer! At long last the search for knowledge will reach out for its due: - it will want to rule and possess, and you with it!
Growth in wisdom can be measured precisely by decline in bile
A history of false flag attacks used to manipulate the minds of the people! In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule
Do I advise you to love thy neighbor? I suggest rather to escape from thy neighbor and to love those who are the farthest away from you. Higher than the love for thy neighbor is the love for the man who is distant and has still to come
Morality negates life
Our crime against criminals lies in the fact that we treat them like rascals
Life has not been devised by morality: it wants deception, it lives on deception
We are, all of us, growing volcanoes that approach the hour of their eruption, but how near or distant that is, nobody knows- not even God
It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the "free will" owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it
Writers whose thoughts are expressed with clarity and precision are assumed by readers to be superficial. Where the meaning is obscured, then readers give more attention and consider the fruit of their labour more valuable
The final reward of the dead - to die no more
A man who wills commands something within himself that renders obedience, or that he believes renders obedience
Every achievement, every step forward in knowledge, is the consequence of courage, of toughness towards oneself, of sincerity to oneself
We set no special value on the possession of a virtue until we percieve that it is entirely lacking in our adversary
The Thought of Death. It gives me a melancholy happiness to live in the midst of this confusion of streets, of necessities, of voices: how much enjoyment, impatience and desire, how much thirsty life and drunkenness of life comes to light here every moment! And yet it will soon be so still for all these shouting, lively, life- loving people! How everyone's shadow, his gloomy travelling companion stands behind him! It is always as in the last moment before the departure of an emigrant- ship: people have more than ever to say to one another, the hour presses, the ocean with its lonely silence waits impatiently behind all the noise-so greedy, so certain of its prey! And all, all, suppose that the past has been nothing, or a small matter, that the near future is everything: hence this haste, this crying, this self-deafening and self-overreaching! Everyone wants to be foremost in this future-and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that men do not want to think at all of the idea of death! I would fain do something to make the idea of life to us to be more than friends in the sense of that sublime possibility. And so we will believe in our even a hundred times more worthy of their attention
We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the way in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us
What really raises one's indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but the senselessness of suffering
The danger in happiness - "Now everything is turning out right for me; from now on i'll love every turn of fate - Who wants to be my fate?
But the thought is one thing, the deed is another, and another yet is the image of the deed. The wheel of causality does not roll between them
God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. Yet his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?
Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy - that is a hermit's judgment: "There is something arbitrary in his stopping here to look back and look around, in his not digging deeper here but laying his spade aside; there is also something suspicious about it."  Every philosophy also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask
You say you're a pessimist, but I happen to know that you're in the habit of practicing your flute for two hours every evening
Visiting the sick' is an orgasm of superiority in the contemplation of our neighbor's helplessness
Love as a passion-it is our European specialty-must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the "gai saber," to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself
Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too young-so have patience with it!
Creating-that is the great salvation from suffering, and life's alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much transformation
Against the censurers of brevity. - Something said briefly can be the fruit of much long thought: but the reader who is a novice in this field, and has as yet reflected on it not at all, sees in everything said briefly something embryonic, not without censuring the author for having served him up such immature and unripened fare
The noble man wants to create something new and a new virtue. The good want the old, and that old should be preserved
Whoever extolls him as a God of love, does not think highly enough of love itself
And when he invented his hell, that was his heaven on earth
The good men of every age are those who go to the roots of the old thoughts and bear fruit with them
Alas, where is there still a sea in which one could drown: thus our lament resounds  across shallow swamps
And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
Light for some time to come will have to be called darkness
If thinking is your fate, revere this fate with divine honour and sacrifice to it the best, the most beloved
When thou goest to woman, take thy whip
It is not the strength, but the duration, of great sentiments that makes great men
And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness
This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light on the stars requires time; deeds though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars - and yet they have done it themselves
[I]n nooks all over the earth sit men who are waiting, scarcely knowing in what way they are waiting, much less that they are waiting in vain.  Occasionally the call that awakens that accident which gives the permission to act - comes too late, when the best youth and strength for action has already been used up by sitting still; and many have found to their horror when they âleaped up that their limbs had gone to sleep and their spirit had become to heavy.  âIt is too late, they said to themselves, having lost their faith in themselves and henceforth forever useless
That which intoxicates, the sensually ecstatic, the sudden surprise, the urge to be profoundly stirred at any price -- dreadful tendencies!
How good music and bad reasons sound when one marches against an enemy
Sharp and mild, dull and keen, well known and strange, dirty and clean, where both the fool and wise are seen: All this am I, have ever been, - in me dove, snake and swine convene!
To live alone one must be either a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out the third case: one must be both - a philosopher
Only ideas won by walking have any value
There are many kinds of eyes.  Even the sphinx has eyes - and consequently there are many kinds of 'truths,' and consequently there is no truth
As an artist, a man has no home in Europe save in Paris
The same passions in man and woman nonetheless differ in tempo; hence man and woman do not cease misunderstanding one another
I might believe in the Redeemer if his followers looked more redeemed
It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn author--and that he did not learn it better
He whom the flame of jealousy encompasses, will at last, like the scorpion, turn the poisoned sting against himself
A day when you haven't danced, you haven't lived
Thus I spoke, more and more softly; for I was afraid of my own thoughts and the thoughts behind my thoughts
Whatever is profound loves masks; what is most profound even hates image and parable
For one thing is needful: that a human being should attain satisfaction with himself, whether it be by means of this or that poetry or art; only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold. Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is constantly ready for revenge, and we others will be his victims, if only by having to endure his ugly sight
There is no pre-established harmony between the furtherance of truth and the well-being of mankind
But how can we venture to reprove or praise the universe!  Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness and unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect nor beautiful nor noble, and has no desire to become any of these; it is by no means striving to imitate mankind!  It is quite impervious to all our aesthetic and moral judgments!  It has likewise no impulse to self-preservation or impulses of any kind; neither does it know any laws.  Let us beware of saying there are laws in nature.  There are only necessities: there is no one to command, no one to obey, no one to transgress..
The greatest weight.-- What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence - even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!" Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus?... Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?
A good author possesses not only his own intellect, but also that of his friends
In every real man, a child is hidden that wants to play
But grant me from time to time-if there are divine goddesses in the realm beyond good and evil-grant me the sight, but one glance of something perfect, wholly achieved, happy, mighty, triumphant, something still capable of arousing fear!  Of a man who justifies man, of a complementary and redeeming lucky hit on the part of man for the sake of which one may still believe in man!
People have always wanted to 'improve' human beings; for the most part, this has been called morality
Anarchists are mouthpieces of a declining stratum of society; when they work themselves into a state of righteous indignation demanding 'rights', 'justice', 'equal rights', they are just acting under the pressure of their own lack of culture, which has no way of grasping why they really suffer, or what they lack in life
To live with tremendous and proud composure; always beyond -.  To have and not to have one's affects, one's pro and con, at will; to condescend to them, for a few hours; to seat oneself on them as on a horse, often as on an ass - for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire.  To reserve one's three hundred foregrounds; also the dark glasses; for there are cases when nobody may look into our eyes, still less into our "grounds."  And to choose for company that impish and cheerful vice, courtesy.  And to remain master of one's four virtues: of courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude
Die at the right time
When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people, and was silent. "There they stand," said he to his heart; "there they laugh: they do not understand me; I am not the mouth for these ears
Besides this I place another equally obvious confirmation of my view that opera is based on the same principles as our Alexandrian culture.  Opera is the birth of the theoretical man, the critical layman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising facts in the history of all the arts.  It was the demand of throughly unmusical hearers that before everything else the words must be understood, so that according to them a rebirth of music is to be expected only when some mode of singing has been discovered in which textword lords it over counterpoint like master over servant: For the words, it is argued, are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic system as the soul is nobler than the body
Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman-a rope over an abyss.  A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting
The worst sickness of men tends to originate in the sentimental way they try to combat their sicknesses. What seems like an easy cure, in the long run produces something worse than what it's supposed to overcome. Fake consolations always have to be paid for with a general and profound worsening of the original complaint
But thus I counsel you, my friends: Mistrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful. They are people of a low sort and stock; the hangmen and the bloodhound look out of their faces. Mistrust all who talk much of their justice! Verily, their souls lack more than honey. And when they call themselves the good and the just, do not forget that they would be pharisees, if only they had-power
When the oppressed, downtrodden, outraged exhort one another with the vengeful cunning of impotence: "let us be different from the evil, namely good! And he is good who does not outrage, who harms nobody, who does not attack, who does not requite, who leaves revenge to God, who keeps himself hidden as we do, who avoids evil and desires little from life, like us, the patient, humble, and just" -- this, listened to calmly and without previous bias, really amounts to no more than: "we weak ones are, after all, weak; it would be good if we did nothing for which we are not strong enough"; but this dry matter of fact, this prudence of the lowest order which even insects possess (popsing as dead, when in great danger, so as not to do "too much"), has, thanks to counterfeit and self-deception of impotence, clad itself in the ostentatious garb of the virtue of quiet, calm resignation, just as if the weakness of the weak -- that is to say, their essence, their effects, their sole ineluctable, irremovable reality - were a voluntary achievement, willed, chosen, a deed, a meritous act
He who knows the reader, does nothing for the reader
Twofold misjudgement. - The misfortune suffered by clear-minded and easily understood writers is that they are taken for shallow and thus little effort is expended on reading them: and the good fortune that attends the obscure is that the reader toils at them and ascribes to them the pleasure he has in fact gained from his own zeal
A degree of culture, and assuredly a very high one, is attained when man rises above superstitions and religious notions and fears, and, for instance, no longer believes in guardian angels or in original sin, and has also ceased to talk of the salvation of his soul
One cannot refute Christianity; one cannot refute a disease of the eye
He who fights monster should beware, lest he become a monster himself
When the gratitude of many to one throws away all shame, we behold fame
My melancholy wants to rest in the hiding places and abysses of perfection: that is why I need music
Whoever fights monsters should beware that he, himself, does not become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
Without music, life would be a mistake.. I would only believe in a God who knew how to dance
We have to cease to think, if we refuse to do it in the prison house of language; for we cannot reach further than the doubt which asks whether the limit we see is really a limit
Man is the most bungled of all the animals, the sickliest, and not one has strayed more dangerously from its instincts. But for all that, of course, he is the most interesting
Our evaluations. - All actions may be traced back to evaluations, all evaluations are original or adopted - the latter being by far the most common.  Why do we adopt them?  From fear - that is to say, we consider it more advisable to pretend they are our own - and accustom ourself to this pretense, so that at length it becomes our own nature.  Original evaluation: that is to say, to assess a thing according to the extent to which it pleases or displeases us alone and no one else - something excessively rare!  But must our evaluation of another, in which there lies motive for our general availing ourselves of his HIS evaluation, at least not proceed from US, be our OWN determination?  Yes, but we arrive at it as children, and rarely learn to change our view; most of us are our whole lives long the fools of the way we acquired in childhood of judging our neighbors (their minds, rank, morality, whether they are exemplary or reprehensible) and of finding it necessary to pay homage to their evaluations
For believe me! - the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is: to live dangerously!
The great periods of our life occur when we gain the courage to rechristen what is bad about us as what is best
Man Is Something That Must Be Overcome
For others do I wait...for higher ones, stronger ones, more triumphant ones, merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in body and soul: laughing lions must come
Ye shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: ye must be proud of your foes
Philosophy is not suited for the masses, what they need is holiness
It is a new step towards independence, once a man dares to express opinions that bring disgrace on him if he entertains them; then even his friends and acquaintances begin to grow anxious. The man of talent must pass through this fire, too; afterwards he is much more his own person
Can you give yourself your own evil and your own good and hang your own will over yourself as a law? Can you be your own judge and avenger of your law? Terrible it is to be alone with the judge and avenger of one's own law. Thus is a star thrown out into the void and into the icy breath of solitude. Today you are still suffering from the many being one: today your courage and your hopes are still whole. But the time will come when solitude will make you weary, when your pride will double up and your courage gnash its teeth. And you will cry, "I am alone!" The time will come when that which seems high to you will no longer be in sight, and that which seems low will be all-too-near; even what seems sublime to you will frighten you like a ghost And you will cry, "All is false!
Mystical explanations are considered deep. The truth is that they are not even superficial
Everything that is deep loves the mask
The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be returned
Tethered heart, free spirit.--If one tethers one's heart severely and imprisons it, one can give one's spirit many liberties
Under peaceful conditions a warlike man sets upon himself
That is an artist as I love artists, modest in his needs: he really wants only two things, his bread and his art - panem et Circen
When virtue has slept it will arise more vigorous
ridendo dicere severum. (tr. Through what is laughable say what is somber.)
A thinking man never be a party man
Not necessity, not desire - no, the love of power is the demon of men
Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce Great Men --this and nothing else is its duty
Thou great star! what would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!
He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you
The chastest expression I have ever heard: 'Dans la vÃ©ritable amour cest lÃ¢me, qui enveloppe le corps
I and me are always too deeply in conversation: how could I endure it, if there were not a friend? The friend of the hermit is always the third one: the third one is the float which prevents the conversation of the two from sinking into the depth
A. Was I ill? Have I got well?    Who was my doctor? Can you tell?    Oh, my memory is rotten! B. Only now you're truly well.    Those are well who have forgotten
When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is usually something wrong with her sexuality
In revenge and in love woman is more barbaric than man is
...the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and greatest enjoyment is - to live dangerously
Only Individuals have a sense of Responsibility
Man does not strive for happiness; only the Englishman does that
Business people - Your business - is your greatest prejudice: it ties you to your locality, to the company you keep, to the inclinations you feel. Diligent in business - but indolent in spirit, content with your inadequacy, and with the cloak of duty hung over this contentment: that is how you live, that is how you want your children to live!
I notice that Autumn is more the season of the soul than of nature
The tension of the soul in unhappiness, which cultivates its strength; its horror at the sight of the great destruction; its inventiveness and bravery in bearing, enduring, interpreting, exploiting unhappiness, and whatever in the way of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cleverness, greatness the heart has been granted - has it not been granted them through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering?
All beings so far have created something beyond themselves
I love all those who are heavy drops falling from the dark cloud that hangs over men: they herald the advent of lightning, and, as heralds, they perish
The feelings of devotion, self-sacrifice for one's neighbor, the whole morality of self-denial must be questioned mercilessly and taken to court.... There is too much charm and sugar in these feelings of 'for others,' 'not for myself,' for us not to need to become doubly suspicious at this point and to ask: 'are these not perhaps-seductions?
A time came when one rubbed one's eyes; one is still rubbing them today
Shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings
What is life? Life - that is: continually shedding something that wants to die. Life - that is: being cruel and inexorable against everything about us that is growing old and weak -and not only about us. Life - that is, then: being without reverence for those who are dying, who are wretched, who are ancient? Constantly being a murderer? -And yet old Moses said: "Thou shalt not kill
What does our great historical hunger signify, our clutching about us of countless cultures, our consuming desire for knowledge, if not the loss of myth, of a mythic home, the mythic womb?
What was silent in the father speaks in the son
Our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge. We are perpetually on the way thither, being by nature winged insects and honey gatherers of the mind
The strongest intimidation, by the way, is the invention of a hereafter with a hell everlasting
Life is a journey so everyone is a tourist
All of life is a dispute over taste and tasting
Beauty is for the artist something outside all orders of rank, because in beauty opposites are tamed; the highest sign of power, namely power over opposites; moreover, without tension:  that violence is no longer needed: that everything follows, obeys, so easily and so pleasantly  that is what delights the artists WILL TO POWER
Popular medicine and popular morality belong together and ought not to be evaluated so differently as they still are: both are the most dangerous pseudo-sciences
I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgets himself, and all things are in him: thus all things become his going under
In solitude the solitary man consumes himself, in the crowd the crowd consumes him
Who have a why to live can bear any how  Ú©Ø³Û Ú©Ù ÚØ±Ø§ÛÛ Ø¯Ø± "Ø²ÙØ¯Ú¯Û" Ø¯Ø§Ø±Ø¯ ØªØ­ÙÙ ÙØ± "ÚÚ¯ÙÙÚ¯Û" Ø±Ø§ Ø¯Ø§Ø±Ø¯
The awakened and knowing say: body I am entirely, and nothing else; and soul is only a word for something about the body
To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but (s)he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses
I am alone again and I want to be so; alone with the pure sky and open sea
You shall love beyond yourselves some day! So first, learn to love. And for that you have to drink the bitter cup of your love
None of the people have any real interest in a science, who only begin to be enthusiastic about it when they themselves have made discoveries in it
This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able to see. . . . I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race..
Not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow, does the enlightened man dislike to wade into its waters
For man to be redeemed from revenge, that is for me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms. Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful!
Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit
To become what one is, one must not have the faintest notion of what one is... The whole surface of consciousness - for consciousness -is- a surface - must be kept clear of all great imperatives. Beware even of every great word, every great pose! So many dangers that the instinct comes too soon to "understand itself" --.  Meanwhile, the organizing idea that is destined to rule keeps growing deep down - it begins to command, slowly it leads us back from side roads and wrong roads; it prepares single qualities and fitnesses that will one day prove to be indispensable as a means toward a whole - one by one, it trains all subservient capacities before giving any hint of the dominant task, "goal," "aim," or "meaning
I am not angry with anybody. But when I am alone it seems to me that I can see my friends in a clearer and rosier light than when I am with them; and when I loved and felt music best I lived far from it. It would seem that I must have distant perspectives in order that I may think well of things
Where one can no longer love, there one should pass by
You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame;  How could you become new if you havent first become ashes
If you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire
All that exists is just and unjust and is equally justified in both respects
Nobody can build the bridge for you to walk across the river of life, no one but you yourself alone. There are, to be sure, countless paths and bridges and demi-gods which would carry you across this river; but only at the cost of yourself; you would pawn yourself and lose. There is in the world only one way, on which nobody can go, except you: where does it lead? Do not ask, go along with it
It was suffering and incapacity that created all afterworlds - this, and that brief madness of bliss which is experienced only by those who suffer deeply.  Weariness that wants to reach the ultimate with one leap, with one fatal leap, a poor ignorant weariness that does not want to want any more: this created all gods and afterworlds
And many such good inventions are there, that they are like womans breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant
In belief in what? In love with what? In hope for what?-Theres no doubt that these weak people-at some time or another they also want to be the strong people, some day their "kingdom" is to arrive-they call it simply "the kingdom of God" as I mentioned. People are indeed so humble about everything! Only to experience that, one has to live a long time, beyond death-in fact, people must have an eternal life, so they can also win eternal recompense in the "kingdom of God" for that earthly life "in faith, in love, in hope." Recompense for what? Recompense through what? In my view, Dante was grossly in error when, with an ingenuity inspiring terror, he set that inscription over the gateway into his hell:"Eternal love also created me." Over the gateway into the Christian paradise and its "eternal blessedness" it would, in  any event, be more fitting to let the inscription stand "Eternal hate also created me"-provided its all right to set a truth over the gateway to a lie! For what is the bliss of that paradise? Perhaps we might have guessed that already, but it is better for it to be expressly described for us by an authority we cannot underestimate in such matters, Thomas Aquinas, the great teacher and saint: "In the kingdom of heaven" he says as gently as a lamb, "the blessed will see the punishment of the damned, so that they will derive all the more pleasure from their heavenly bliss
I deny morality as I deny alchemy
The wittiest authors raise the very slightest of smiles
Aphorisms should be peaks  and those who are addressed, tall and lofty. The air thin and pure, danger near, and the spirit full of gay sarcasm: these go well together
Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully. 'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle
The sedentary life...is the real sin against the holy spirit
Water is sufficient...the spirit moves over water
All sciences are now under the obligation to prepare the ground for the future task of the philosopher, which is to solve the problem of value, to determine the true hierarchy of values
Creation-that is the great redemption from suffering, and life's growing light. But that the creator may be, much suffering is needed and much change. Indeed, there must be much bitter dying in your life, you creators
In conversation we are sometimes confused by the tone of our own voice, and mislead to make assertions that do not at all correspond to our opinions
... first learn to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; ..
One should adopt only those situations in which is in no need of sham virtues, but rather, like the tight-rope dancer on his tight rope, in which one must either fall or stand - or escape
Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do they only believe the stammerer?
For this is how things are: the diminution and leveling of European man constitutes our greatest danger, for the sight of him makes us weary.-We can see nothing today that wants to grow greater, we suspect that things will continue to go down, down, to become thinner, more good-natured, more prudent, more comfortable, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more Christian-there is no doubt that man is getting 'better' all the time
Yet tell me, my brothers: if a goal for humanity is still lacking, is there not still lacking--humanity itself?
The struggle of maturity is to recover the seriousness of a child at play
If you invest all your energy in economics, world commerce, parliamentarianism, military engagements, power and power politics, -if you take the quantum of intelligence, seriousness, will, and self-overcoming that you embody and expend it all in this one direction, there there won't be any left for the other direction. Culture and the state - let us be honest with ourselves - these are adversaries
All great artists and thinkers are great workers
Warning to the despised. If you have unmistakably sunk in the estimation of men you should hold on like grim death to decorum in society with others: otherwise you will betray to them that you have sunk in your own estimation too. When a man is cynical in society it is a sign that he treats himself like a dog when he is alone
Moderation sees itself as beautiful; it is unaware that in the eye of the immoderate it appears black and sober and consequently ugly-looking
Insight: all evaluation is made from a definite perspective: that of the preservation of the individual, a community, a race, a state, a church, a faith, a culture.--- Because we forget that valuation is always from a perspective, a single individual contains within him a vast confusion of contradictory valuations and consequently of contradictory drives.  This is the expression of the diseased condition in man, in contrast to the animals in which all existing instincts answer to quite definite tasks.     This contradictory creature has in his nature, however, a great method of acquiring knowledge: he feels many pros and cons, he raises himself to justice---to comprehension beyond esteeming things good and evil.    The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions, who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men---as well as his great moments of grand harmony---a rare accident even in us!  A sort of planetary motion---
Everything in proximity to the hero becomes tragedy; everything in proximity to the demigod becomes satyr-play; and everything in proximity to God becomes...what? "world" perhaps?
Poets treat their experiences shamelessly: they exploit them
What therefore is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms: in short a sum of human relations which became poetically and rhetorically intensified, metamorphosed, adorned, and after long usage seem to a notion fixed, canonic, and binding; truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions; worn-out metaphors which have become powerless to affect the senses; coins which have their obverse effaced and now are no longer of account as coins but merely as metal
Books for the masses are always bad-smelling books: the odour of little people cling to them
Once the soul looked contemptuously upon the body, and then that contempt was the supreme thing: - the soul wished the body lean, monstrous, and famished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth. But that soul was itself lean, monstrous, and famished; and cruelty was the delight of this soul! So my brothers, tell me: What does your body say about your soul? Is not your soul poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency?
Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by: they do not know what is meant by yesterday or today, they leap about, eat, rest, digest, leap about again, and so from morn till night and from day to day, fettered to the moment and its pleasure or displeasure, and thus neither melancholy nor bored. This is a hard sight for man to see; for, though he thinks himself better than the animals because he is human, he cannot help envying them their happiness  what they have, a life neither bored nor painful, is precisely what he wants, yet he cannot have it because he refuses to be like an animal  [Man] also wonders at himself, that he cannot learn to forget but clings relentlessly to the past: however far and fast he may run, this chain runs with him. And it is a matter for wonder: a moment, now here and then gone, nothing before it came, again nothing after it has gone, nonetheless returns as a ghost and disturbs the peace of a later moment. A leaf flutters from the scroll of time, floats away  and suddenly floats back again and falls into the mans lap. Then the man says âI remember and envies the animal, who at once forgets and for whom every moment really dies, sinks back into night and fog and is extinguished forever
So long as the priest, that denier, calumniator and poisoner of life by profession, still counts as a higher kind of human being, there can be no answer to the question: what is truth? One has already stood truth on its head when the conscious advocate of denial and nothingness counts as the representative of âtruth
And he will also find the little god whom girls like best: beside the well he lies, still, with his eyes shut. Verily, in bright daylight he fell asleep, the sluggard! Did he chase after the butterflies too much?... He may cry and weep - but he is laughable even when he weeps. And with tears in his eyes he shall ask you for a dance and I myself will sing a song for his dance: a dancing and mocking song on the spirit of gravity... (p.108 - The Dancing Song)
But if you have an enemy, do not requite him evil with good, for that would put him to shame.  Rather prove that he did you some good.   And rather be angry than put to shame.  And if you are cursed, I do not like that you want to bless.  Rather join a little in the cursing
It is not their love for men, rather it is the impotence of their love that hinders Christians of today from burning us
They believe one becomes selfless in love because one desires the advantage of another human being, often against one's own advantage.  But in return for that they want to possess the other person
Behold, I bring you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beg of you my brothers, remain true to the earth, and believe not those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them!
And must I not conceal myself like one who has swallowed gold- lest my soul should be ripped up?
Whoever knows he is deep, strives for clarity; whoever would like to appear deep to the crowd, strives for obscurity. For the crowd considers anything deep if only it cannot see to the bottom: the crowd is so timid and afraid of going into the water
Here is the great city: here have you nothing to seek and everything to lose
Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster
God is a conjecture; but I desire that your conjectures should be limited by what is thinkable. Can you think a god? [...] You should think through your own senses to their consequences
Loneliness is one thing, solitude another: you have learned that - now!
Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one
To say it for those who know how to explain a thing: women have the intelligence, men the heart and passion. This is not contradicted by the fact that men actually get so much farther with their intelligence: they have the deeper, more powerful drives; these take their intelligence, which is in itself something passive, forward. Women are often privately amazed at the great honor men pay to their hearts. When men look especially for a profound, warm-hearted being, in choosing their spouse, and women for a clever, alert, and brilliant being, one sees very clearly how a man is looking for an idealized man, and a woman for an idealized woman--that is, not for a complement, but for the perfection of their own merits
Some cannot loosen their own chains and can nonetheless redeem their friends
One should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air
I am the leading strings of the ego and the prompter of its concepts
In a real man there is a child hidden: it wants to play. Up then, you women, and discover the child in man!
It is a pity that there was no Dostoevsky living near this most interesting decadent [Jesus], I mean someone with an eye for the distinctive charm that this sort of mixture of sublimity, sickness, and childishness has to offer
I want, once and for all, not to know many things. Wisdom requires moderation in knowledge as in other things
Pity preserves things that are ripe for decline, it defends things that have been disowned and condemned by life, and it gives a depressive and questionable character to life itself by keeping alive an abundance of failures of every type. People have dared to call pity a virtue  people have gone even further, making it into the virtue, the foundation and source of all virtues, - but of course you always have to keep in mind that this was the perspective of a nihilistic philosophy that inscribed the negation of life on its shield. Schopenhauer was right here: pity negates life, it makes life worthy of negation, - pity is the practice of nihilism. Once more: this depressive and contagious instinct runs counter to the instincts that preserve and enhance the value of life: by multiplying misery just as much as by conserving everything miserable, pity is one of the main tools used to increase decadence - pity wins people over to nothingness!   You do not say ânothingness : instead you say âthe beyond; or âGod; or âthe true life; or nirvana, salvation, blessedness   This innocent rhetoric from the realm of religious-moral idiosyncrasy suddenly appears much less innocent when you see precisely which tendencies are wrapped up inside these sublime words: tendencies hostile to life
It is the stillest words which bring the storm
The state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen
Good and evil, and joy and pain, and I and you- colored vapors did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away from himself,- and so he created the world
One must reach out and try to grasp this astonishing finesse, that the value of lif cannot be estimated
Skepticism regarding morality is what is decisive
When, however, you have an enemy, then do not requite him good for evil: for that would shame him. Instead, prove that he did some good for you. And rather be angry than put to shame! And when you are cursed, I do not like it that you want to bless. Rather curse a little also! And if you are done a great injustice, then quickly add five small ones. Hideous to behold is he who is obsessed with an injustice
The secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and greatest enjoyment is - to live dangerously
...the Germans love frankness and honesty.  It is so convenient to be frank and honest.  This confidingness, this complacence, this showing the cards of German honesty, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays
That immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated intellect. And when it smashes this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it is demonstrating that it has no need of these makeshifts of indigence and that it will now be guided by intuitions rather than by concepts. There is no regular path which leads from these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard - of combinations of concepts. He does this so that by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers he may at least correspond creatively to the impression of the powerful present intuition
Interpreting myself, I always read Myself into my books. I clearly need Some help. But all who climb on their own way Carry my image, too, into the breaking day
Nihilism is not only the belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough; one destroys

When I picture a perfect reader, I always picture a monster of courage and curiosity, also something supple, cunning, cautious, a born adventurer and discoverer
As the "people of the centre" in every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French
Willing emancipates: for willing is creating: so do I teach. And only for creating shall you learn!
[339] Vita femina. To see the ultimate beauties in a work-all knowledge and good-will is not enough; it requires the rarest, good chance for the veil of clouds to move for once from the summits, and for the sun to shine on them. We must not only stand at precisely the right place to see this, our very soul itself must have pulled away the veil from its heights, and must be in need of an external expression and simile, so as to have a hold and remain master of itself. All these, however, are so rarely united at the same time that I am inclined to believe that the highest summit of all that is good, be it work, deed, man, or nature, has hitherto remained for most people, and even for the best, as something concealed and shrouded-that, however, which unveils itself to us, unveils itself to us but once. The Greeks indeed prayed: "Twice and thrice, everything beautiful!" Ah, they had their good reason to call on the Gods, for ungodly actuality does not furnish us with the beautiful at all, or only does so once! I mean to say that the world is overfull of beautiful things, but it is nevertheless poor, very poor, in beautiful moments, and in the unveiling of those beautiful things. But perhaps this is the greatest charm of life: it puts a gold- embroidered veil of lovely potentialities over itself, promising, resisting, modest, mocking, sympathetic, seductive. Yes, life is a woman!
The existence of forgetting has never been proved: we only know that some things do not come to our mind when we want them to
Dangerous Helpfulness. There are people who want to make men's lives more difficult for no other reason than afterwards to offer them their prescriptions for making life easier -- their Christianity, for example
Women can form a friendship with a man very well; but to preserve it, a slight physical antipathy most probably helps

The certain prospect of death could sweeten every life with a precious and fragrant drop of levity; and now you strange apothecary souls have turned it into an ill-tasting drop of poison that makes the whole of life repulsive
It is not enough that you understand in what ignorance man and beast live; you must also have and acquire the will to ignorance.  You need to grasp that without this kind of ignorance life itself would be impossible, that it is a condition under which alone the living thing can preserve itself and prosper: a great, firm dome of ignorance must encompass you
Was it not part of the secret black art of truly grand politics of revenge, of a farseeing, subterranean, slowly advancing, and premeditated revenge, that Israel must itself deny the real instrument of its revenge before all the world as a mortal enemy and nail it to the cross, so that 'all the world,' namely all the opponents of Israel, could unhesitatingly swallow just this bait?  And could spiritual subtlety imagine any more dangerous bait than this?  Anything to equal the enticing, intoxicating, overwhelming, and undermining power of that symbol of the 'holy cross,' that ghastly paradox of a 'God on the cross,' that mystery of an unimaginable ultimate cruelty and self-crucifixion of God for the salvation of man?
The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe
Man has been reared by his errors: first he never saw himself other than imperfectly, second he attributed to himself imaginary qualities, third he felt himself in a false order of rank with animal and nature, fourth he continually invented new tables of values and for a time took each of them to be eternal and unconditional...If one deducts the effect of these four errors, one has also deducted away humanity, humaneness, and 'human dignity'
To make an individual uncomfortable, that is my task
The images of myth must be the daemonic guardians, omnipresent and unnoticed, which protect the growth of the young mind, and guide man's interpretation of his life and struggles
Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child

Men after death are understood worse than men of the moment, but heard better
Association with other people corrupts our character; especially when we have none
This book belongs to the most rare of men. Perhaps not one of them is yet alive. It is possible that they may be among those who understand my Zarathustra: how could I confound myself with those who are now sprouting ears?-First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men are born posthumously
The true world -- we have abolished. What world has remained? The apparent one perhaps? But no! With the true world we have also abolished the apparent one
Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman-a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting
Oh, my friends, that your self be in your deed as the mother is in her child - let that be your word concerning virtue!
One still works, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one

He who maketh no secret of himself shocketh; so much reason have ye to fear nakedness! Aye, if ye were Gods, ye could then be ashamed of clothing!
In truth, nothing could be more opposed to the purely aesthetic interpretation and justification of the world which are taught in this book than the Christian teaching, which is, and wants to be, only moral and which relegates art, every art, to the realm of lies; with its absolute standards, beginning with the truthfulness of God, it negates, judges, and damns art
You shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: you must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught
On a political sickbed a people is usually rejuvenated and rediscovers its spirit, after having gradually lost it in seeking and preserving power. Culture owes its peaks to politically weak ages
The great wars of the present age are the effects of the study of history
1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this "Will to Truth" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will-until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us-or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk
One is necessary, one is a piece of fate, one belongs to the whole, one is the whole  there exists nothing which could judge, measure, compare, condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, condemn the whole But nothing exists apart from the whole!
Now and then, in philosophers or artists, one finds a passionate and exaggerated worship of 'pure forms': no one should doubt that a person who so needs the surface must once have made an unfortunate grab underneath it. Perhaps these burnt children, the born artists who find their only joy in trying to falsify life's images (as if taking protracted revenge against it-), perhaps they may even belong to a hierarchy: we could tell the degree to which they are sick of life by how much they wish to see its image adulterated, diluted, transcendentalized, apotheosized- we could count the homines religiosi among the artists, as their highest class
It was only Christianity, with resentment against life in its foundations, which made sexuality something impure: it threw filth on the beginning, on the prerequisite of our life
For it is the fate of every myth to creep by degrees into the narrow limits of some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later generation as a unique fact with historical claims...this is the way in which religions are wont to die out: under the stern, intelligent eyes of an orthodox dogmatism, the mythical premises of a religion are systematized as a sum total of historical events; one begins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myths, while at the same time one opposes any continuation of their vitality and growth; the feeling for myth perishes, and its place is taken by the claim of religion to historical foundations
4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life- preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live-that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil
Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke.  Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.  Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly, however, shall thine eye show unto me: free FOR WHAT?
Dionysus had already been scared form the tragic stage, by a demonic power speaking through Euripides.  Even Euripides was, in a sense, only a mask: the deity that spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor Apollo, but an altogether newborn demon, called Socrates
It is an eternal phenomenon: the insatiable will always finds a way to detain its creatures in life and compel them to live on, by means of an illusion spread over things
The anthropological criminologists tell us that the typical criminal is ugly: monstrum in fronte, monstrum in animo [monstrous in appearance, monstrous in spirit]

The misunderstanding of passion and reason, as if the latter were an independent entity and not rather a system of relations between various passions and desires; and as if every passion did not possess its quantum of reason
Like tourists huffing and puffing to reach the peak we forget the view on the way up
The more you let yourself go, the less others let you go
If, in all that you wish to do, you begin by asking yourself: am I certain that I would wish to do this an infinite number of times? This should be for you the most solid centre of gravity . . . My doctrine says, the task is to live your life in such a way that you must wish to live it again - for you will anyway! If striving gives you the highest feeling, then strive! If rest gives you the highest feeling, then rest! If fitting in, following and obeying give you the highest feeling, then obey! Only make sure you come to know what gives you the highest feeling, and then spare no means. Eternity is at stake! This doctrine is mild in its treatment of those who do not believe in it. It has neither hell nor threats. But anyone who does not believe merely lives a fugitive life in the consciousness of it
What if, some day or night, a demon were to steal after you in your loneliest loneliness and say to you: This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence-even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again-and you with it, speck of dust!... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine
The state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all - is called "life." Just see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the inventors and the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their theft - and everything becometh sickness and trouble unto them! Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves
Another Christian concept, no less crazy, has passed even more deeply into the tissue of modernity: the concept of the 'equality of souls before God.' This concept furnishes the prototype of all theories of equal rights..
There are various eyes. Even the Sphinx has eyes: and as a result there are various truths, and as a result there is no truth
In woman's love there is injustice and blindness to all she does not love. And even in woman's conscious love, there is still always attack and lightning and night, along with the light
Dostoevsky,the only psychologist from whom I've anything to learn
The thought of suicide is a great consolation. It has helped me through many a weary night
At this point, I can no longer avoid setting out, in an initial, provisional statement, my own hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience. It is not easy to get people to attend to it, and it requires them to consider it at length, to guard it, and to sleep on it. I consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with, under the pressure of the most fundamental of all the changes which they experienced-that change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace. Just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off, so events must have played themselves out with this half-beast so happily adapted to the wilderness, war, wandering around, adventure-suddenly all its instincts were devalued and disengaged.  From this point on, these animals were to go on foot and carry themselves; whereas previously they had been supported by the water. A terrible heaviness weighed them down. In performing the simplest things they felt ungainly. In dealing with this new unknown world, they no longer had their old leader, the ruling unconscious drives which guided them safely. These unfortunate creatures were reduced to thinking, inferring, calculating, bringing together cause and effect, reduced to their consciousness, their most impoverished and error-prone organ! I believe that on earth there has never been such a feeling of misery, such a leaden discomfort-while at the same time those old instincts had not all at once stopped imposing their demands! Only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their bidding. For the most part, they had to find new and, as it were, underground satisfactions for them
With hard men intimacy is a thing of shame- and something precious

If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you?
One puts to ones lips what drives one faster into the abyss
To what end the âworld exists, to what end âmanÂ­kind exists, ought not to concern us at all for the moment except as objects of humour: for the presumptuousness of the little human worm is the funniest thing at present on the worlds stage; on the other hand, do ask yourself why you, the individual, exist, and if you can get no other answer try for once to justify the meaning of your existence as it were a posteriori by setting before yourself an aim, a goal, a âto this end, an exalted and noble âto this end . Perish in pursuit of this and only this - I know of no better aim of life than that of perishing, animae magnae prodigus, in pursuit of the great and the impossible. If, on the other hand, the doctrines of sovereign becoming, of the fluidity of all concepts, types and species, of the lack of any cardinal distinction between man and animal - doctrines which I consider true but deadly - are thrust upon the people for another generation with the rage for instruction that has by now become normal, no one should be surprised if the people perishes of petty egoism, ossification and greed, falls apart and ceases to be a people; in its place sysÂ­tems of individualist egoism, brotherhoods for the rapacious exploitation of the non-brothers, and similar creations of utilitarian vulgarity may perhaps appear in the arena of the future. To prepare the way for these creations all one has to do is to go on writing history from the standpoint of the masses and seeking to derive the laws which govern it from the needs of these masses, that is to say from the laws which move the lowest mud- and clay-strata of society. The masses seem to me to deserve notice in three respects only: first as faded copies of great men produced on poor paper with worn-out plates, then as a force of resistance to great men, finally as instruments in the hands of great men; for the rest, let the Devil and statistics take them!
Men need play & danger. Civilization gives them work and safety
Wherever life and knowledge seemed to contradict each other, there was never any serious struggle: in such cases, denial and doubt amounted to madness
The process of evolution does not necessarily mean elevation, enhancement, strengthening

In truth, man is a polluted river. One must be a sea to receive a polluted river without becoming defiled. I bring you the Superman! He is that sea; in him your great contempt can be submerged
What is love but understanding and rejoicing that another lives, works, and feels in a different and opposite way to ourselves? That love may be able to bridge over the contrasts by joys, we must not remove or deny those contrasts
Intoxicating joy it is for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, the world once seemed to me

The time is gone when mere accidents could still happen to me; and what could still come to me now that was not mine already? What returns, what finally comes home to me, is my own self and what of myself has long been in strange lands and scattered among all things and accidents
Always look on the bright side of the abyss
Another thing is war. I am naturally warlike. Attacking is one of my instincts. Being able to be an enemy, being an enemy - these require a strong nature, perhaps; in any case every strong nature presupposes them. It needs resistances, so it seeks resistance: aggressive pathos is just as integrally necessary to strength as the feeling of revenge and reaction is to weakness. Woman, forinstance, is vengeful: that is a condition of her weakness, as is her sensitivity to other peoples afï¬ictions. - The strength of anattacker can in a way be gauged by the opposition he requires; allgrowth makes itself manifest by searching out a more powerful opponent - or problem: for a philosopher who is warlike challenges problems to duels, too. The task is not to master all resistances, but only those against which one has to pit ones entire strength, suppleness, and mastery-at-arms - opponents who are equal..
The Christian church is an encyclopaedia of prehistoric cults and conceptions of the most diverse orgiin and that is why it is so capable of proselytising: it always could and it can still go wherever it pleases and it always found and it always finds something similar to itself to which it can adapt itself and gradually impose upon it a Christian meaning
Is life not a hundred times too short for us to stifle ourselves?
Man permits himself to be lied to at night, his life long, when he dreams, and his moral sense never even tries to prevent this-although men have been said to have overcome snoring by sheer will power
If a man has a great deal to put in them, a day will have a hundred pockets
I put forward at once - lest I break with my style, which is affirmative  and deals with contradiction and criticism only as a means, only involuntarily - the  three tasks for which educators are required. One must learn to see, one must learn to  think, one must learn to speak and write: the goal in all three is a noble culture.  Learning to see - accustoming the eye to calmness, to patience, to letting things  come up to it; postponing judgment, learning to go around and grasp each individual  case from all sides. That is the first preliminary schooling for spirituality: not to react  at once to a stimulus, but to gain control of all the inhibiting, excluding instincts
The false contrasts which the people, and consequently the language, believes in, are always dangerous fetters which impede the march of truth
Under the magic of the Dionysian, not only does the bond between man and man lock itself in place once more, but also nature itself, no matter how alienated, hostile, or subjugated, rejoices again in her festival of reconciliation with her prodigal son, man. The earth freely offers up her gifts, and the beasts of prey from the rocks and the desert approach in peace. The wagon of Dionysus is covered with flowers and wreaths; under his yolk stride panthers and tigers
The free intellect copies human life, but it considers this life to be something good and seems to be quite satisfied with it. That immense framework and planking of concepts to which the needy man clings his whole life long in order to preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and toy for the most audacious feats of the liberated intellect. And when it smashes this framework to pieces, throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing the most alien things and separating the closest, it is demonstrating that it has no need of these makeshifts of indigence and that it will now be guided by intuitions rather than by concepts
Do you deserve truth? You sure seek it, but do you deserve it? If you want to see real things burning you first have to reach up to the height of the fire
It is the noble races that have left behind them the concept 'barbarian' wherever they have gone; even their highest culture betrays a consciousness of it and even a pride in it (for example, when Pericles says to the Athenians in his famous funeral oration 'our boldness has gained access to every land and sea, everywhere raising imperishable monuments to its goodness and wickedness").  This 'boldness' of noble races, mad, absurd, and sudden in its expression, the incalculability, even incredibility of their undertakings-Pericles specially commends the rhathymia of the Athenians-their indifference to and contempt for security, body, life, comfort, their hair-raising cheerfulness and profound joy in all destruction, in all the voluptuousness of victory and cruelty-all this came together, in the minds of those who suffered from it, in the image of the 'barbarian,' the 'evil enemy,' perhaps as the 'Goths,' the 'Vandals
All too violently my heart still flows toward you-my heart, upon which my summer burns, short, hot, melancholy, overblissful; how my summer heart craves your coolness
What can everyone do? Praise and blame. This is human virtue, this is human madness
The Hour-Hand of Life --- Life consists of rare, isolated moments of the greatest significance, and of innumerably many intervals, during which at best the silhouettes of those moments hover about us. Love, springtime, every beautiful melody, mountains, the moon, the sea  all these speak completely to the heart but once, if in fact they ever do get a chance to speak completely. For many men do not have those moments at all, and are themselves intervals and intermissions in the symphony of real life
My taste, which may be the opposite of a tolerant taste, is in this case very far from saying Yes indiscriminately: it does not like to say Yes;better to say No, but best of all to say nothing
When a human being resists his whole age and stops it at the gate to demand an accounting, this must have influence
The sum of the inner movements which a man finds easy and as a consequence performs gracefully and with pleasure, one calls his soul; if these inner movements are plainly difficult and an effort for him, he is considered soulless
The man looked up distrustfully. "If you speak the truth," said he, "I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal which has been taught to dance by blows and a few scraps of food
It is not your sin - it is your moderation that cries to heaven; your very sparingness in sin cries to heaven!
As long as a man knows very well the strength and weaknesses of his teaching, his art, his religion, its power is still slight. The pupil and apostle who, blinded by the authority of the master and by the piety he feels toward him, pays no attention to the weaknesses of a teaching, a religion, and soon usually has for that reason more power than the master. The influence of a man has never yet grown great without his blind pupils. To help a perception to achieve victory often means merely to unite it with stupidity so intimately that the weight of the latter also enforces the victory of the former
A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting
What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an over-going and a down-going
Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers. He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers-and spirit itself will stink
But strangers and the poor may pluck for themselves the fruit from my tree: that causes less shame. But beggars should be entirely done away with! Truly, it annoys one to give to them and it annoys one not to give to them
Spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But finally he had a change of heart
On Truth and Lie What is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms  in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins
Facta! Yes, Facta ficta! - A historian has to do, not with what actually happened, but only with events supposed to have happened: for only the latter have produced an effect. Likewise only with supposed heroes. His theme, so-called world history, is opinions about supposed actions and their supposed motives, which in turn give rise to further opinions and actions, the reality of which is however at once vaporised again and produces an effect only as vapour - a continual generation and pregnancy of phantoms over the impentetrable mist of unfathomable reality. All historians speak of things which have never existed except in imagination
When your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, a blessing and a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin of your virtue
So I ask my pride that it always go along with my wisdom. And when my wisdom leaves me one day alas - it loves to flyway - let my pride then fly with my folly
One who cannot leave himself behind on the threshold of the moment and forget the past, who cannot stand on a single point, like a goddess of victory, without fear or giddiness, will never know what happiness is; and, worse still, will never do anything that makes others happy
But I am still far from them, and my sense does not speak to their sense. To men I am something between a fool and a corpse
Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious
For, confronted with morality (especially Christian, or unconditional, morality), life must continually and inevitably be in the wrong, because life is something essentially amoral--and eventually, crushed by the weight of contempt and the eternal No, life must then be felt to be unworthy of desire and altogether worthless
Knowing one's 'individuality'. - We are too prone to forget that in the eyes of people who are seeing us for the first time we are something quite different from what we consider ourselves to be: usually we are nothing more than a single individual trait which leaps to the eye and determines the whole impression that we make
Let us imagine a coming generation with such intrepidity of vision, with such a heroic penchant for the tremendous; let us imagine the bold stride of these dragon-slayers, the proud audacity with which they turn their back on all the weakling's doctrines of optimism in order to 'live resolutely' in wholeness and fullness: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of such a culture, in view of his self-education for seriousness and terror, to desire a new art, the art of metaphysical comfort, to desire tragedy as his own proper Helen, and to exclaim with Faust:  Should not my longing overleap the distance And draw the fairest form into existence?"  "Would it not be necessary?"--No, thrice no!  O you young romantics: it would not be necessary!  But it is highly probably that it will end that way, that you end that way--namely, "comforted," as it is written, in spite of all self-education for seriousness and terror, "comforted metaphysically"--in sum, as romantics end, as Christians
Where we encounter the "naÃ¯ve" in art, we should recognize the highest effect of Apollinian culture--which always must first overthrow an empire of Titans and slay monsters, and which must have triumphed over an abysmal and terrifying view of the world and the keenest susceptibility to suffering through recourse to the most forceful and pleasurable illusions
The men of the period of corruption are witty and calumnious; they know that there are yet other ways of murdering than by the dagger and ambush--they know also that all that is well said is believed in
A man recovers best from his exceptional nature - his intellectuality - by giving his animal instincts a chance
Atheism and a kind of _second innocence_ belong together
One might be tempted to extol as an advance over Sophocles the radical tendency of Euripides to produce a proper relation between art and the public.  But "public," after all, is a mere word.  In no sense is it a homogeneous and constant quantity.  Why should the artist be bound to accommodate himself to a power whose strength lies solely in numbers?  And if, by virtue of his endowments and aspirations, he should feel himself superior to every one of these spectators, how could he feel greater respect for the collective expression of all these subordinate capacities than for the relatively highest-endowed individual spectator?
You have been a poor observer of life if you have not also seen the hand that, ever so gently  kills
For those who need consolation no means of consolation is so effective as the assertion that in their case no consolation is possible: it implies so great a degree of distinction that they at once hold up their heads again
The whole attitude of 'man against the world', of man as a 'world-negating' principle, of a man as the measure of the value of things, as judge of the world who places existence itself on his scales and finds it too light - the monstrous stupidity of this attitude has finally dawned on us and we are sick of it; we laugh as soon as we encounter the juxtaposition of 'man and world', separated by the sublime presumptuosness of the little word 'and!' But by laughing, haven't we simply taken contempt for man one step further?
An artist chooses his subjects.. that is the way he praises
Neither can such a doctrine argue: it simply does not understand that other doctrines exist, can exist, it simply does not know how to imagine an opinion contrary to its own
Flight from boredom is the mother of all art
I will teach men the meaning of their existence: the Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud- man
As long as the sole ruler and disposer of the universe, the nous, remained excluded from artistic activity, things were mixed together in a primeval chaos: this was what Euripides must have thought; and so, as the first "sober" one among them, he had to condemn the "drunken" poets.  Sophocles said of Aeschylus that he did what was right, though he did it unconsciously.  This was surely not how Euripides saw it.  He might have said that Aeschylus, because he created unconsciously, did what was wrong.  The divine Plato, too, almost always speaks only ironically of the creative faculty of the poet, insofar as it is not conscious insight, and places it on a par with the gift of the soothsayer and dream-interpreter: the poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and bereft of understanding
How changed Zarathustra is! Zarathustra has become a child, an awakened one. What do you plan to do in the land of the sleepers? You have been floating in a sea of solitude, and the sea has borne you up. At long last, are you ready for dry land? Are you ready to drag yourself ashore?
You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love
Without myth, however, every culture loses its healthy creative natural power: it is only a horizon encompassed with myth that rounds off to unity a social movement
Des jugements, des apprÃ©ciations de la vie, pour ou contre, ne peuvent, en derniÃ¨re instance, jamais Ãªtre vrais : ils nont dautre valeur que celle dÃªtre des symptÃ´mes - en soi de tels jugements sont des stupiditÃ©s. Il faut donc Ã©tendre les doigts pour tÃ¢cher de saisir cette finesse extraordinaire que la valeur de la vie ne peut pas Ãªtre apprÃ©ciÃ©e. Ni par un vivant, parce quil est partie, mÃªme objet de litige, et non pas juge : ni par un mort, pour une autre raison. - De la part dun philosophe, voir un problÃ¨me dans la valeur de la vie, demeure mÃªme une objection contre lui, un point dinterrogation envers sa sagesse, un manque de sagesse
A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come and go at the right time. So does it accord with good sleep
I live in my own light, I drink back into myself the flames that break from me
The greatest events- they are not noisiest but our stillest hours. The world revolves, not around the inventors of new noises, but around the inventors of new values; it revolves inaudibly
Write with blood, and you will find that blood is spirit
Anyone who manages to experience the history of humanity as a whole as his own history will feel in an enormously generalized way all the grief of an invalid who thinks of health, of an old man who thinks of the dream of his youth, of a lover deprived of his beloved, of the martyr whose ideal is perishing, of the hero on the evening after a battle that has decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of his friend. But if one endured, if one could endure this immense sum of grief of all kinds while yet being the hero who, as the second day of battle breaks, welcomes the dawn and his fortune, being a person whose horizon encompasses thousands of years, past and future, being the heir of all the nobility of all past spirit - an heir with a sense of obligation, the most aristocratic of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility - the like of which no age has yet seen or dreamed of; if one could burden ones soul with all of this - the oldest, the newest, losses, hopes, conquests, and the victories of humanity; if one could finally contain all this in one soul and crowd it into a single feeling - this would surely have to result in a happiness that humanity has not known so far: the happiness of a god full of power and love, full of tears and laughter, a happiness that, like the sun in the evening, continually bestows its inexhaustible riches, pouring them into the sea, feeling richest, as the sun does, only when even the poorest fishermen is still rowing with golden oars! This godlike feeling would then be called - humaneness
The Church today is more likely to alienate than to seduce..
I attack only things that are triumphant - if necessary, I wait until they become triumphant
If the Christian dogmas of a revengeful God, universal sinfulness, election by divine grace and the danger of eternal damnation were true, it would be a sign of weak-mindedness and lack of character not to become a priest, apostle or hermit and, in fear and trembling, to work solely on one's own salvation; it would be senseless to lose sight of ones eternal advantage for the sake of temporal comfort. If we may assume that these things are at any rate believed true, then the everyday Christian cuts a miserable figure; he is a man who really cannot count to three, and who precisely on account of his spiritual imbecility does not deserve to be punished so harshly as Christianity promises to punish him.  from Nietzsche's Human, all too Human
Moral contempt is a far greater indignity and insult than any kind of crime
It is only great pain--that slow, sustained pain that takes its time, in which we are, as it were, burned with smoldering green firewood--that forces us philosophers to sink to our ultimate profundity and to do away with all the trust, everything good-natured, veil-imposing, mild and middling, on which we may have previously based our humanity. I doubt that such a pain makes us 'better'--but I know that it makes us deeper
But an essentially mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world! Suppose that one assessed the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted, calculated, put into formulas; how absurd such a 'scientific' assessment of music would be! What would one have comprehended, understood, known about it? Nothing, absolutely nothing of what is really 'music' in it!
The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence
What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence ... ' Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him, 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.'  ... The question in each and every thing, 'Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?' would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight
Egoism is the law of perspective applied to feelings: what is closest appears large and weighty, and as one moves farther away size and weight decrease
I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough  I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race
Why?" said Zarathustra. "Thou askest why? I do not belong to those who may be asked after their Why
He who considers more deeply knows that, whatever his acts and judgements may be, he is always wrong
What the father has hidden comes out in the son, and often have I found the son to be a father's revealed secret
Youth's longing misconceived inconsistency. Those whom I deemed Changed to my kin, the friends of whom I dreamed, Have aged and lost our old affinity: One has to change to stay akin to me
Stupidity in a woman is unwomanly
(Broad daylight; breakfast; return of cheerfulness and bons sens; Plato blushes for shame; all free spirits run riot.)
How much blood and horror is at the bottom of all 'good things'!
Life without music is a mistake
The actual stronghold of a man is inaccessible, almost invisible, until friends and enemies turn traitor- and lead him there by a secret path
I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go.      Once the sin against God was the greatest sin; but God died, and these sinners died with him. To sin against the earth is now the most dreadful thing, and to esteem the entrails of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth...      What is the greatest experience you can have? It is the hour of the great contempt. The hour when your happiness, too, arouses your disgust, and even your reason and your virtue
When the Christian crusaders in the Orient came across that invincible order of Assassins  that order of free spirits par excellence whose lowest order received, through some channel or other, a hint about that symbol and spell reserved for the uppermost echelons alone, as their secret: "nothing is true, everything is permitted". Now that was freedom of the spirit, with that, belief in truth itself was renounced
Zarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so spake: When one taketh his hump from the hunchback, then doth one take from him his spirit-so do the people teach. And when one giveth the blind man eyes, then doth he see too many bad things on the earth: so that he  curseth him who healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, inflicteth upon him the greatest in him - so do the people teach concerning cripples
This is Europe's true predicament: together with the fear of man we have also lost the love of man, reverence for man, confidence in man, indeed the will to man. Now the sight of man makes us weary. What is nihilism today if not that?
Ork and boredom.- Looking for work in order to be paid:  in civilized countries today almost all men are at one in doing  that. For all of them work is a means and not an end in itself.  Hence they are not very refined in their choice of work, if only  it pays well. But there are, if only rarely, men who would rather  perish than work without any pleasure in their work. They are  choosy, hard to satisfy, and do not care for ample rewards. if  the work itself is not the reward of rewards. Artists and contemplative men 9Â£ all kinds belongÂ· to this rare breed, but so  do even those men of leisure who spend their Jives hunting.  traveling, or in love affairs and adventures. All of these desire  work and misery if only it is associated with pleasure. and the  hardest. most difficult work if necessary. Otherwise. their idleness is resolute. even if it speI1s impoverishment, dishonor, and  danger to life and limb. They do not fear boredom as much as  work without pleasure; they actually require a lot of boredom  if their work is to succeed. For thinkers and aU sensitive spirits.  boredom is that disagreeable "windless calm" of the soul that  precedes a happy voyage and cheerful winds. They have to bear  it and must wait for its effect on them. Precisely this is what  lesser natures cannot achieve by any means. To ward off boredom at any cost is vulgar, no less than work without pleasure.  Perhaps Asians are distinguished above Europeans by a capacity  for longer, deeper calm; even their opiates have a slow effect and require patience, as opposed to the disgusting suddenness of the European poison, alcohol
Life no argument. - We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life. But that does not prove them. Life is no argument. The conditions of life might include error
Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the superman - a rope over an abyss
Life is a dark chain of events
The best author will be the one who is ashamed to become a writer
Out of love alone shall my despising and my warning bird fly up, not out of swamp. (...) Where one can no longer love, there one should pass by
Truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors that have become worn-out and deprived of their sensuous force, coins that have lost their imprint and are now no longer seen as coins but as metal
Excess of strength alone is proof of strength
I live in my own place.  I never copied anybody, not even half.  And at any master who lacks the grace to laugh at himself, I laugh
Become who you are
There are many more languages than one imagines.  And man reveals himself much more often than he wishes.  So many things that speak!  But there are always so few listeners, so that man, so to speak, only chatters in a void when he engages in confessions.  He wastes his truths just as the sun wastes its light.  Isn't it too bad that the void has no ears?
Live so that thou mayest desire to live again - that is thy duty - for in any case thou wilt live again!
Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority-- where he may forget "men who are the rule," as their exception;-- exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense
In reality, hope is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs mans torments
But let me reveal my heart to you entirely, my friends: if there were gods, how could I endure not to be a god! Hence there are no gods
And now we celebrate, in victory bound,      The feast of feasts: Friend Zarathustra came, the guest of guests! Now laughs the world, the ancient curtain's torn, And light and darkness wedded are as one..
The Olympian vice.--In defiance of that philosopher who as true Englishman tried to give any thinking person's laughter a bad reputation ('Laughter is a nasty infirmity of human nature that any thinking person will endeavour to overcome'---Hobbes), I would actually go as far as to rank philosophers according to the level of their laughter---right up to the ones who are capable of golden laughter.  And assuming that gods, too, are able to philosophize, as various of my conclusions force me to believe, then I do not doubt when they do so, they know how to laugh in a new and superhuman fashion---and at the expense of everything serious!  Gods like to jeer: it seems that even at religious observances they cannot keep from laughing
The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us
Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman- a rope over an abyss
All beings so far have created something beyond themselves. Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than surpass mankind? What is the ape to a man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just so shall a man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. You have evolved from worm to man, but much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes
Amor fati: this is the very core of my being-And as to my prolonged illness, do I not owe much more to it than I owe to my health? To it I owe a higher kind of health, a sort of health which grows stronger under everything that does not actually kill it!-To it, I owe even my philosophy.  Only great suffering is the ultimate emancipator of spirit, for it teaches one that vast suspiciousness which makes an X out of every U, a genuine and proper X, i.e., the antepenultimate letter. Only great suffering; that great suffering, under which we seem to be over a fire of greenwood, the suffering that takes its time-forces us philosophers to descend into our nethermost depths, and to let go of all trustfulness, all good-nature, all whittling-down, all mildness, all mediocrity,-on which things we had formerly staked our humanity
The surest way to corrupt a youth? Teach him to value thinking alike more than thinking differently
Even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes
Every acquisition, every step forward in knowledge is the result of courage, of severity toward oneself, of cleanliness with respect to oneself
The Alexandrian man, who is basically a librarian and copy editor and goes miserably blind from the dust of books and printing errors
It is not only he who speaks contrary to what he knows who lies, but even more he who speaks contrary to what he does not know
If God wrote the New Testament, he knew surprisingly little Greek
Let man fear woman when she loves. then she bears every sacrifice and every other thing she accounts valueless
I have been casting shadows all my life without caring about how deeply they stain my soul
The crowd of influences streaming on the young soul is so great, the clods of barbarism and violence flung at him so strange and overwhelming, that an assumed stupidity is his only refuge
To be sure: except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into that kingdom of heaven [and Zarathustra pointed upward with his hands]. but we have no wish whatever to enter into the kingdom of heaven: we have become men - so we want the earth
I should like to direct the attention of artists. A constant producer, a man who is a "mother" in the grand sense of the term, one who no longer knows or hears of anything except pregnancies and childbeds of his spirit, who has no time at all to reflect and make comparisons with regard to himself and his work, who is also no longer inclined to exercise his taste, but simply forgets it, letting it take its chance of standing, lying or falling -- perhaps such a man at last produces works on which he is then quite unfit to pass a judgment: so that he speaks and thinks foolishly about them and about himself. This seems to me almost the normal condition with fruitful artists
In truth man is polluted river. one must be a sea to receive a polluted river without becoming defiled
2. "HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own-in this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itself- THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!"-
Of all the evil I deem you capable. Therefore I want the good from you. Verily I have often laughed at weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws
Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to integrity must know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not only errs when he speaks, but actually lies-and that he no longer escapes blame for his lie through innocence or ignorance. The priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any God,
One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa-- blessing it rather than in love with it
O my brothers, your nobility should not look backward but ahead! Exiles shall you be from all father- and forefather-lands! Your children's land shall you love: this love shall be your new nobility - the undiscovered land in the most distant sea. For that I bid your sails search and search. In your children you shall make up for being the children of your fathers: thus shall you redeem all that is past
It says nothing against the ripeness of a spirit that it has a few worms
Love brings the high and concealed characteristics of the lover into the light--what is rare and exceptional in him: to that extent it easily deceives regarding his normality
One person seeks a midwife for his thoughts; the other, someone he can assist. Here is the origin of a good conversation
Life is hard to bear: but do not pretend to be so delicate!
Was it not because I loved man all-too-much? Now I love God. man I love not. Man is for me too imperfect a thing. Love of man would kill me
Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know what has fallen into their depths
How foolish it would be to suppose that one only needs to point out this origin and this misty shroud of delusion in order to destroy the world that counts for real, so-called 'reality.' We can destroy only as creators. -- But let us not forget this either: it is enough to create new names and estimations and probabilities in order to create in the long run new 'things
Our faith in others betrays that we would rather have faith in ourselves
The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared such a vast number of great individuals.  How was this possible? This question is one which ought to be studied
Valuing is creating: hear it, you creators! Valuing itself is the treasure and jewel of all valued things
I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers
Only when he has attained a final knowledge of all things will man have come to know himself. For things are only the boundaries of man
This is my way, what is your way?  The way doesn't exist
You need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
What strange, perplexing, questionable questions!
I am not upset that you lie to me ,  I am upset that from now on I cant believe u
...all that is rare is for the rare
An instinct is weakened when it rationalises itself: for by rationalising itself it weakens itself
Now and again an echo of Chopins music rings in my ears, and this much you absorb me that, at such moments I always think of you and lose myself in meditating about possibilities
Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think highly enough of love itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving one loveth irrespective of reward and requital
In order to think and infer it is necessary to assume beings: logic handles only formulas for what remains the same. That is why this assumption would not be a proof of reality: 'beings' are part of our perspective. ... The fictitious world of subject, substance, 'reason,' etc., is needed-: there is in us a power to order, simplify, falsify, artificially distinguish. ... What then is truth? A moveable host of metaphors, metonomies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force,
For ten years you have climbed here to my cave: you would have become weary of shining and of the journey, had it not been for me, my eagle, and my serpent
What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal
Your bad love of yourselves makes solitude a prison to you
He who is a firstling is ever sacrificed
Go your ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!- gloomy ways, verily, on which not a single hope glints any more!
The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others
Nothing succeeds if prankishness has no part in it
Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood
When he judged himself, that was his supreme moment
Supposing that what is at any rate believed to be the 'truth' really is true, and the meaning of all culture is the reduction of the beast of prey 'man' to a tame and civilized animal, a domestic animal, then one would undoubtedly have to regard all those instincts of reaction and ressentiment through whose aid the noble races and their ideals were finally confounded and overthrown as the actual instruments of culture; which is not to say that the bearers of these instincts themselves represent culture.  Rather is the reverse not merely probable-no! today it is palpable!  These bearers of the oppressive instincts that thirst for reprisal, the descendants of every kind of European and non-European slavery, and especially of the entire pre-Aryan populace-they represent the regression of mankind!  These 'instruments of culture' are a disgrace to man and rather an accusation and counterargument against 'culture' in general!
A hearty meal is easier to digest than one that is too small
Alas, I have begun my loneliest walk. But whoever is of my kind, cannot escape such an hour, the hour which says to him, 'Only now are you going your way to greatness. Peak and abyss, they are now joined together, for all things are baptized in a well of eternity, and lie beyond good and evil
What is it that I especially find utterly unendurable?  That I cannot cope with, that makes me choke and faint?  Bad air!  Bad air!  The approach of some ill-constituted thing; that I have to smell the entrails of some ill-constituted soul!
That which you term "moderation", I call "mediocrity
Enjoyment belongs to those who know things halfway
Every characteristic absence of spirituality, every piece of common vulgarity, is due to an inability to resist a stimulus - you have to react, you follow every impulse
But having quills is a waste, even a double luxury when one can choose not to have quills but open hands
Freedom of Will"-that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order-who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful "underwills" or under-souls-indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls-to his feelings of delight as commander
Kalian tak akan pernah bahagia karena kesalahan kalian di masa lalu
It is to be hoped, indeed, that LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation
They dislike, therefore, to hear of 'contempt' of themselves. So I will appeal to their pride
When your heart flows broad and full like a river, a blessing and a danger to those living near: there is the origin of your virtue.  When you are above praise and blame, and your will wants to command all things, like a lover's will: there is the origin of your virtue.  When you despise the agreeable and the soft bed and cannot bed yourself far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.  When you will with a single will and you call this cessation of all need "necessity": there is the origin of your virtue.  Verily, a new good and evil is she. Verily, a new deep murmur and the voice of a new well!  Power is she, this new virtue; a dominant thought is she, and around her a wise soul: a golden sun, and around it the serpent of knowledge
So bless me then, you tranquil eye that can behold even the greatest happiness without envy!
...For action has no sense. It merely binds one to existence. All existence, however, has no sense. Evil is interpreted as that which leads to irrationalism: to the affirmation of means whose end is denied. A road to nonentity is the desideratum, hence all emotional impulses are regarded with horror
It is good to express a matter in two ways simultaneously so as to give it both a right foot and a left. Truth can stand on one leg, to be sure; but with two it can walk and get about
Why," said the saint, "did I go into the forest and the desert? Was it not because I loved mankind far too well? Now I love God! Mankind I do not love; mankind is a thing too imperfect for me. Love of mankind would be fatal to me
If there is to be art, if there is to be any aesthetic doing and seeing, one physiological condition is indispensable: frenzy
Works, first and foremost! That is to say, doing, doing, doing! The 'faith' that goes with it will soon put in an appearance - you can be sure of that!
...all concepts in which an entire process is semiotically concentrated elude definition; only that which has no history is definable
The architect represents neither a Dionysian nor an Apollinian condition: here it is the mighty act of will, the will which moves mountains, the intoxication of the strong will, which demands artistic expression. The most powerful men have always inspired the architects; the architect has always been influenced by power
Even the wisest among you is only a confusion and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I ask you to become phantoms or plants?
Every profound spirit needs a mask
Out of your poisons you brewed your balsam. You milked your cow, melancholy; now you drink the sweet milk of her udder
Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? The man who breaks their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker:- yet he is the creator
Lonely now and miserably self-distrustful, I took sides, not without resentment, against myself and for everything that hurt me and was hard to me
They have something of which they are proud. What do they call it, that which makes them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguishes them from the goatherds
We are so fond of being out in Nature because it has no opinions of us
The philosopher is lacking who interprets the deed and does not merely transpose it
By saying 'God sees into the heart' it denies the deepest and the highest desires of life and takes God for the enemy of life. The saint in whom God takes pleasure is the ideal castrate. Life is at an end where the kingdom of God begins
The creator seeks companions, not corpses- and not herds or believers either. The creator seeks fellow-creators - those who grave new values on new law-tablets
I and me are always too deeply in conversation
Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest man and the smallest man. All too similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the greatest found I all too human
[...] let us go with all our "devils" to the help of our "god"!
For some time now, our whole European culture has been moving with a tortured tension that is growing from decade to decade, as toward a catastrophe: restlessly, violently, headlong, like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer reflects, that is afraid to reflect
You utlilitarians, you too love everything useful only as avehicle of your inclinations - you too really find the noise of its wheels intolerable?
I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument.But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses
Whoever approaches these Olympians with another religion in his heart, searching among them for moral elevation, even for sanctity, for disincarnate spirituality, for charity and benevolence, will soon be forced to turn his back on them, discouraged and disappointed.  For there is nothing here that suggests asceticism, spirituality, or duty.  We hear nothing but the accents of an exuberant, triumphant life in which all things, whether good or evil, are deified
Thus do the gods justify the life of man: they themselves live it--the only satisfactory theodicy!
[Dionysos'] being torn into pieces, the genuine Dionysiac suffering, is like a transformation into air, water, earth, and fire, so that we are to regard the state of individuation as the source and primal cause of all suffering.... In the view described here we already have all the constituent elements of a profound way of looking at the world and thus, at the same time, the doctrine of the Mysteries taught by tragedy: the fundamental recognition that everything which exists is a unity; the view that individuation is the primal source of all evil; and art as the joyous hope that the spell of individuation can be broken, a premonition of unity restored
There is a point in every philosophy at which the "conviction" of the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient mystery: adventavit asinus, / pulcher et fortissimus. (Translation: The ass arrives, beautiful and most brave.)
In this condition one enriches everything out of one's own abundance: what one sees, what one desires, one sees swollen, pressing, strong, over laden with energy. The man in this condition transforms things until they mirror his power - until they are reflections of his perfections
It is unworthy of great spirits to spread abroad the agitation they feel
The bright image projections of the Sophoclean hero--in short, the Apollinian aspect of the mask--are necessary effects of a glance into the inside and terrors of nature; as it were, luminous spots to cure eyes damaged by gruesome night.  Only in this sense may we believe that we properly comprehend the serious and important concept of "Greek cheerfulness."  The misunderstanding of this concept as cheerfulness in a state of unendangered comfort is, of course, encountered everywhere today
Swallow your poison, for you need it badly
In the heroic effort of the individual to attain universality, in the attempt to transcend the curse of individuation and to become the one world-being, he suffers in his own person the primordial contradiction that is concealed in things, which means that he commits sacrilege and suffers
Two seemingly antagonistic forces, equally deleterious in their actions and ultimately combining to produce their results, are at present ruling over our educational institutions, although these were based originally upon very different principles. These forces are: a striving to achieve the greatest possible extension of education on the one hand, and a tendency to minimize and to weaken it on the other. The first-named would fain spread learning among the greatest possible number of people; the second would compel education to renounce its highest and most independent claims in order to subordinate itself to the service of the State
The man who is to be great is the one who can be the most solitary, the most hidden, the most deviant, the man beyond good and evil, lord of his virtues, a man lavishly endowed with will - this is precisely what greatness is to be called: it is able to be as much a totality as something multi-faceted, as wide as it is full
He who has perceived the material out of which the Promethean tragic writers prior to Euripides formed their heroes, and how remote from their purpose it was to bring the faithful mask of reality onto the stage, will also be aware of the utterly opposite tendency of Euripides.  Through him the everyday man forced his way from the spectators' seats onto the stage; the mirror in which formerly only grand and bold traits were represented now showed the painful fidelity that conscientiously reproduces even the botched outlines of nature
Who has not for the sake of his reputation sacrificed himself?
So long as the spectator has to figure out the meaning of this or that person, or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations and purposes, he cannot become completely absorbed in the activities and sufferings of the chief characters or feel breathless pity and fear
That which now calls itself democracy differs from older forms of government solely in that it drives with new horses: the streets are still the same old streets, and the wheels are likewise the same old wheels
Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, transferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid, canonical, and binding to a nation.  Truths are illusions about which it has been forgotten that they are illusions.  from "On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense
Plato's objection to the older art--that it is the imitation of a phantom and hence belongs to a sphere even lower than the empirical world--could certainly not be directed against the new art; and so we find Plato endeavoring to transcend reality and to represent the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality
Why does Homer give us descriptions so much more vivid than all the poets. Because he sees so much more around him. We speak about poetry so abstractly because we all tend to be poor poets. The aesthetic phenomenon is fundamentally simple: if someone simply possesses the capacity to see a living game going on continually and to live all the time surrounded by hordes of ghosts, then the man is a poet; if someone simply feels the urge to change himself and to speak out from other bodies and souls, then that person is a dramatist
Plato has given to all posterity the model of a new art form, the model of the novel--which may be described as an infinitely enhanced Aesopian fable, in which poetry holds the same rank in relation to dialectical philosophy as this same philosophy held for many centuries in relation to theology: namely the rank of ancilla
The great problems are to be encountered in the street
The tremendous historical need of our unsatisfied modern culture, the assembling around one of countless other cultures, the consuming desire for knowledge--what does all this point to, if not to the loss of myth, the loss of the mythical home, the mythical maternal womb?
Sicknesses, especially those affecting nerves and head, are signs that the defensive strength of the strong natures is lacking; precisely this is suggested by irritability, so pleasure and displeasure become foreground problems
The frost of loneliness makes me shiver
A very popular error: having the courage of one's convictions-? Rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on one's convictions
Being sick is itself a kind of ressentiment. - Against this the invalid has only one great means of cure - I call it Russian fatalism, that fatalism without rebellion with which a Russian soldier for whom the campaign has become too much at last lies down in the snow
First, one has the difficulty of emancipating oneself from ones chains; and, ultimately, one has to emancipate oneself from this emancipation too
Solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people, society, inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every community makes people-base
Honor to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked government! So desires good sleep. How can I help it, if power likes to walk on crooked legs?
Our ancestors pay the price for who we are
What makes life 'worth living'? - The awareness that there is something for which one is ready to risk one's life
Dare only to believe in yourselves- in yourselves and in your inward parts! He who does not believe in himself always lies
Genius too does nothing but learn first how to lay bricks then how to build, and continually seek for material and continually form itself around it.Every activity of man is amazingly complicated, not only that of the genius: but none is a âmiracle
We know the way; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth. Who else has found it?-The man of today?-I dont know either the way out or the way in; I am whatever doesnt know either the way out or the way in-so sighs the man of today  . This is the sort of modernity that made us ill,-we sickened on lazy peace
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those that could not hear the music
If there is something to pardon in everything, there is also something to condemn
Man has to believe, to know, from time to time why he exists; his race cannot flourish without a periodic trust in life  without faith in reason in life
The intense clarity of the image failed to satisfy us, for it seemed to hide as much as it revealed; and while it seemed to invite us to pierce the veil and examine the mystery behind it, its luminous concreteness nevertheless held the eye entranced and kept it from probing deeper
This book is intended for calm readers
New struggles.--After Buddha was dead, his shadow was still displayed in a cave for centuries--a colossal, horrible shadow. God is dead. But as is the way of human beings, there may still be caves for millennia in which his shadow is displayed. And we--we must still defeat even his shadow!
If the poet is not a real genius, I do not know what a genius is
Sometimes, teachers must be hard.  People must be given a hard message because life is hard, and dying is hard,
They cast injustice and filth at the solitary one: but, my brother, if you would be a star, you must shine for them none the less on that account!
Whatever they may think and say about their "egoism", the great majority nonetheless do nothing for their ego their whole life long: what they do is done for the phantom of their ego which has formed itself in the heads of those around them and has been communicated to them
We are noble, good, beautiful, and happy!
My wisdom has accumulated long like a cloud, it becomes stiller and darker. So does all wisdom which shall one day bear lightnings.-
The most spiritual person, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge-a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of person: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest
I have at all times written my writings with my whole heart and soul: I do not know what purely intellectual problems are
All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment       ( )      Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman-a rope over an abyss       What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under
When I came to men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation: all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men
No one tells me anything new, so I tell myself my own story
This - is now my way: where is yours?' Thus I answered those who asked me 'the way'. For the way - does not exist!
Do I then strive after happiness? I strive after my work!
Excelsior! You will never again pray, never again repose in limitless trust - you deny it to yourself to remain halted before an ultimate wisdom, ultimate good, ultimate power, and there unharness your thoughts
To the man of science, on his unassuming and laborious travels, which must often enough be journeys through the desert, there appear those glittering mirages called 'philosophical systems'; with bewitching deceptive power they show the solution of all enigmas and the freshest draught of the true water of life to be near at hand; his heart rejoices, and it seems to the weary traveller that his lips already touch the goal of all the perseverance and sorrows of the scientific life... Other natures again, may well grow exceedingly ill-humoured and curse the salty taste which these apparitions leave behind in the mouth and from which arises a raging thirst  without one having been brought so much as a step nearer to any kind of spring
...wherever the strength of a faith steps decisively into the foreground, we  infer a certain weakness in its ability to demonstrate its truth, even the improbability of what it believes. We, too, do not deny that the belief makes blessed, but for that very reason we deny that the belief proves something-a strong belief which confers blessedness creates doubts about what it has faith in. It does not ground truth. It grounds a certain probability- delusion
Why should one live? All is vain! To live- that is to thresh straw; to live- that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.-
We should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh
The world itself is a filthy monster
I tell you: one must still have chaos within oneself, to give birth to a dancing star
To love mankind for the sake of God-that has been the most nobel and far-fetched feeling yet achieved by human beings. The idea that without some sanctifying ulterior motive, a love of mankind is just one more brutish stupidity, that the predisposition to such a love must first find its weight, its refinement, its grain of salt and pinch of ambergris in another even higher predisposition-whoever first felt and 'witnessed' this, and however much his tongue may have stuttered in attempting to express such a delicate idea: may he remain forever venerable and holy in our sight as the man who as yet has flown the highest and erred the most beautifully!
Whatever may be your desire to accomplish great deeds, the deep silence of pregnancy never comes to you! The event of the day sweeps you along like straws before the wind whilst ye lie under the illusion that ye are chasing the event,-poor fellows! If a man wishes to act the hero on the stage he must not think of forming part of the chorus; he should not even know how the chorus is made up
The domestication (the culture) of man does not go deep--where it does go deep it at once becomes degeneration (type: the Christian).  The 'savage' (or, in moral terms, the evil man) is a return to nature--and in a certain sense his recovery, his cure from 'culture'
For the male sickness of self-contempt, the surest cure is to be loved by a clever woman
Youth is an unpleasant period; for then it is not possible or not prudent to be productive in any sense whatsoever
Thus says the fool: "Association with men spoils the character, especially when one has none
Why should one live? All is vain! To live - that is to thresh straw; to live - that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.- Such ancient babbling still passes for "wisdom"; because it is old, however, and smells mustily, therefore is it the more honoured. Even mould ennobles.- Children might thus speak: they shun the fire because it has burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom. And he who ever "threshes straw," why should he be allowed to rail at threshing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle! Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even good hunger: - and then do they rail: "All is vain!" But to eat and drink well, my brothers, is truly no hath burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom. And he who ever thrasheth straw, why should he be allowed to rail at thrashing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle! Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even good hunger:-and then do they rail: All is vain! But to eat and drink well, my brethren, is verily no vain art! Break up, break up for me the tables of the never-joyous ones!
Even the wisest among you is only a conflict and hybrid of plant and ghost
Discovering that one is loved in return really ought to disenchant the lover with the beloved. 'What? this person is modest enough to love even you? Or stupid enough? Or-or-
We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice
Christianity is the metaphysics of the hangman
The least step forward in the domain of free thought and individual life has been achieved in all ages to the accompaniment of physical and intellectual tortures: and not only the mere step forward, no! but every form of movement and change has rendered necessary innumerable martyrs, throughout the entire course of thousands of years which sought their paths and laid down their foundation-stones, years, however, which we do not think of when we speak about world-history, that ridiculously small division of mankind's existence. And even in this so-called world-history, which in the main is merely a great deal of noise about the latest novelties, there is no more important theme than the old, old tragedy of the martyrs who tried to move the mire
With the new morning, however, there came unto me a new truth: then did I learn to say: "Of what account to me are market-place and populace and populace-noise and long populace- ears!
Many a man fails to become a thinker for the sole reason that his memory is too good
We like to be out in nature so much because it has no opinion about us
With regard to philosophical metaphysics, I always see increasing numbers who have attained to the negative goal, but as yet few who climb a few rungs backwards; one ought to look out, perhaps, over the last steps of the ladder, but not try to stand upon them
Not doubt, CERTAINTY is what drives one insane
Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the madness with which you should be cleansed
People who comprehend a thing to its very depths rarely stay faithful to it forever. For they have brought its depths into the light of day: and in the depths there is always much that is unpleasant to see
To stay cheerful when involved in a gloomy and exceedingly responsible business is no inconsiderable art: yet what could be more necessary than cheerfulness? Nothing succeeds in which high spirits play no part. Only excess of strength is proof of strength
Hunger attacks me," said Zarathustra, "like a robber. Among forests and swamps my hunger attacks me, and late in the night
Thereafter Zarathustra went on again for two hours, trusting to the path and the light of the stars:
Women are still cats and birds. Or at the best, cows
The fact that humanity knelt down before the opposite of the origin, the meaning, the right of the evangel, the fact that in the concept of âchurch, humanity canonized the very thing the âbearer of glad tidings felt to be beneath him, behind him - you will not find a greater example of world-historical irony - -
What an age experiences as evil is usually an untimely reverberation echoing what was previously experienced as good-the atavism of an older ideal
One will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribed to vanity, ordinary actions to habit, and mean actions to fear
I ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought,-but everything oppressed me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse dream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.- But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto slain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still and say: "Dwarf! Thou! Or I!"- For courage is the best slayer,-courage which attacketh: for in every attack there is sound of triumph. Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby hath he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain. Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth man not stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself-seeing abysses? Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering. Fellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man looketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering. Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it slayeth even death itself; for it saith: "Was that life? Well! Once more!
Sleep knocks on my eyes: they grow heavy. Sleep touches my mouth: it stays open. Truly, he comes to me on soft soles, the dearest of thieves, and steals my thoughts from me
The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently
Zarathustra has become a child, an awakened one
79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love, betrays its sediment: its dregs come up
More honestly and purely speaks the healthy body, perfect and square-built; and it speaks of the meaning of the earth.-
Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage- it is called Self; it dwells in your body, it is your body
There is more wisdom in your body than in your best wisdom. And who then knows why your body needs precisely your best wisdom?
215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our "firmament," are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal-and there are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED
You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I say unto you: it is the good war that hallows any cause. War and courage have accomplished more great things than love of the neighbor. Not your pity but your courage has so far saved the unfortunate
You implanted your highest goal into the heart of those passions: then they became your virtues and joys
Are you genuine? or just a play-actor? A representative? it the actual thing represented?-Ultimately you are even just an imitation play-actor....Second question for the conscience
No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wants the same; everyone is the same: he who has other sentiments goes voluntarily into the madhouse
Mathematics would certainly have not come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no actual circle, no absolute magnitude
At the moment when anyone begins to take philosophy seriously, all the world believes the opposite. -Human, All Too Human, Assorted Opinions and Maxims,
Though the favourites of the gods die young, they also live eternally in the company of gods." - Friedrich Nietzsche
I see you exhausted by poisonous flies; I see you bleeding and torn at a hundred spots; and your pride refuses even to be angry.  They would have blood from you in all innocence; blood is what bloodless souls crave - and therefore they sting in all innocence
In every real man a child is hidden that wants to play
He wants to be known deep down, abysmally deep down, before he is capable of being loved at all; he dares to let himself be fathomed. He feels that his beloved is fully in his possession only when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for his devilry and hidden insatiability as for his graciousness, patience, and spirituality
God is dead
The worst mutilation of man that can be imagined presented as the "good man"
You creating ones, you higher men! Whoever has to give birth is sick; whoever has given birth, however, is unclean. Ask women: one gives birth, not because it gives pleasure. The pain makes hens and poets cackle. You creating ones, in you there is much uncleanliness. That is because you have had to be mothers. A new child: oh, how much new filth has also come into the world! Go apart! He who has given birth shall wash his soul!
Sometimes, you have to love beyond yourself! And that's how you learn to love! That's why you had to drink the bitter glass of your love
Hold the capacity of feeling to be the most important and elemental, as providing the foundation for every sound and real growth; everything that is truly great and human
138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse-and forget it immediately
You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm
I am a yea-sayer
Is it better to out-monster the monster or to be quietly devoured
Whoever reaches his ideal transcends it eo ipso
Greatness of character consists in having ones feelings under control. And even without any pleasure in this restraint, but merely because
He who seeks may easily get lost himself. All solitude is wrong": so say the herd. And long did you belong to the herd
The surest aid in combating the male's disease of self-contempt is to be loved by a clever woman
The beast lives unhistorically; for it 'goes into' the present, like a number, without leaving any curious remainder
One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is - which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella,- is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue
How Rhythm Beautifies.- Rhythm casts a veil over reality; it causes various artificialitys of speech and obscurities of thought; by the shadow it throws upon thought it sometimes conceals it, and sometimes brings it into prominence. As shadow is necessary to beauty, so the dull is necessary to lucidity. Art makes the aspect of life endurable by throwing over it the veil of obscure thought
Our destiny exercises its influence over us even when, as yet, we have not learned its nature: it is our future that lays down the law of our today
Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS US-be a fiction?
It is obvious that my head does not stand properly on my shoulders; for it is well known that everyone else knows better than I what I should do and not do: only I, poor rogue, do not know what I should be at. Are we not all like statues with the wrong heads on them? Isn't that so, my dear neighbor? - But no, you, precisely you, are the exception
For that I must descend into the depths, as you do in the evening when you go below the sea and bring light also to the underworld, you superabundant star!
Pity thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural selection. It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction;
The great works are produced in such an ecstasy of love that they must always be unworthy of it, however great their worth otherwise
Said ye ever Yea to one joy? O my friends, then said ye Yea also unto ALL woe. All things are enlinked, enlaced and enamoured
Every past is worth condemning
What is the greatest thing you can experience? It is the hour of your greatest contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becomes loathsome to you, and so also your reason and virtue

A good book is made better by good readers and clearer by good opponents
Woe entreats: Go! Away, woe! But all that suffers wants to live, that it may become ripe and joyous and longing- longing for what is farther, higher, brighter. "I want heirs"- thus speaks all that suffers; "I want children; I do not want myself".   Joy, however, does not want heirs, or children- joy wants itself, wants eternity, wants recurrence, wants everything eternally the same
Prejudice of the learned.  The learned judge correctly that people of all ages have believed they know what is good and evil, praise- and blameworthy. But it is a prejudice of the learned that we now know better than any other age
What a school of politeness is such a contemplation of the past! To take everything objectively, to be angry at nothing, to love nothing, to understand everything-- makes one gentle and pliable
We suffer from the malady of words, and have no trust in any feeling that is not stamped with its special word
They would have to sing better songs to make me believe in their Redeemer; his disciples would have to look more redeemed!
Without music, life would be an error
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could noy hear the music
Behold how each of your virtues is covetous of the highest place; each wants your whole spirit to be her herald, it wants your whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love
You will not get the crowd to cry Hosanna until you ride into town on an ass
To love those who despise us, and to give one's hand to the phantom who tries to frighten us?
But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they unto me, and stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:- In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would save them from their Saviour!
Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful? Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity! Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: "Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man." And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died
Our age knows better.... What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent-it is indecent to be a Christian today
The forumula of my happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal
Whoever fights monsters should see that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you
The demand to be loved is the greatest of all arrogant presumptions
Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed
Nevertheless, I am versed in the use of two weapons: saber and cannon - and, perhaps, one other . .
WHEN Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But finally he had a change of heart - and rising one morning with the dawn, he went before the sun, and spoke thus to it:
He who delights in solitude is either a wild beast or a god
He has heart who knows fear, but vanquishes it; who sees the abyss, but with pride. He who sees the abyss, but with eagle's eyes,- he who with eagle's talons grasps the abyss: he has courage
The emergence of pessimistic philosophies is by no means a sign of great and terrible misery. The emergence of pessimistic philosophies is by no means a sign of great and terrible misery. No, these question marks about the value of all life are put up in ages in which the refinement and alleviation of existence make even the inevitable mosquito bites of the soul and the body seem much too bloody and malignant and one is so poor in real experiences of pain that one would like to consider painful general ideas as suffering of the first order.  There is a recipe against pessimistic philosophers and the excessive sensitivity that seems to me the real "misery of the present age" ----but this recipe may sound too cruel and might itself be counted among the signs that lead people to judge that "existence is something evil." Well, the recipe against this "misery" is: misery
There is always some madness in love.but there is also always some reason in madness
The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself." - Friedrich Nietzsche
Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger in one's soul?
Or is it this: To be sick and send away the comforters, and to make friends of the deaf, who never hear your requests?
Books for general reading always smell badly. The odor of common people hangs about them
What is heavy? so asks the spirit that would bear much, and then kneels down like the camel, and wants to be well laden
Somebody said: "About two persons I have never reflected very thoroughly: that is the testimony of my love for them
Joys want the eternity of all things, they want deep, profound eternity!
There may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something
The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel Nay, the tedium, the cutting-into-the-quick-how seldom do THESE come together! Out of such seed, however-is truth produced!
O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in "the truth," and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it too humanely-"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien"-I wager he finds nothing!
Without the errors which are active in every psychical pleasure and displeasrue a humanity would never have come into existence--whose fundamental feeling is and remains that man is the free being in a world of unfreedom, the external miracle worker whether he does good or ill, the astonishing exception, the superbeast and almost-god, the  meaning of creation which cannot be thought away, the solution of the cosmic riddle, the mighty ruler over nature and the despiser of it, the creature which calls its history world history!--Vanitas vanitatum homo
A rebel can be a miserable and contemptible man; but there is nothing contemptible in a revolt as such - and to be a rebel in view of contemporary society does not in itself lower the value of a man. There are even cases in which one might have to honour a rebel,because he finds something in our society against which war ought to be waged - he wakens us from our slumber
What is the sign of every literary decadence? That life no longer dwells in the whole. The word becomes sovereign and leaps out of the sentence, the sentence reaches out and obscures the meaning of the page, the page gains life at the expense of the whole-the whole is no longer a whole
How could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?
There are many good inventions on earth, some useful, some pleasing: for their sake, the earth is to be loved. And there is such a variety of well-invented things that the earth is like the breasts of a woman: useful as well as pleasing
The peculiar, withdrawn attitude of the philosopher, world denying, hostile to life, suspicious of the senses, freed from sensuality, which has been maintained down to the most modern times and has become virtually the philosophers pose par excellence-is above all a result of the emergency conditions under which philosophy arose and survived at all; for the longest time, philosophy would not have been possible at all on earth without ascetic wraps and cloaks, without an ascetic self-misunderstanding. To put it vividly: the ascetic priest provided until the most modern times the repulsive and gloomy caterpillar form in which alone the philosopher could live and creep about
When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and revengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites. At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful, more like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old grandmother
One must need spirit toacquire spirit; one loses it when one no  longer needs it. Whoever has strength dispenses with the spirit
The craft, trade, agriculture, science, a large part of the art - all this can only stand on a broad base , on a consolidated, strong and healthy mediocrity. Served in their services and the science of their work - and even the arts. We cannot wish for better: it belongs to such an average sort of person - it is under displace exceptions - it has nothing aristocratic about something and still les in their anarchic instincts - The power of the center is then held upright by the trade, especially the money market: the instinct of great financiers goes against all extremes, - the Jews are the reason for the time being conserve power in our so insecure and threatened Europe
The main concern of all great religions has been to fight a certain weariness and heaviness grown to epidemic proportions
My soul is calm and bright as the morning mountains. But they believe I am cold, that I jeer, that I deal in terrible jests. And now they look at me and laugh, and in laughing they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter
What then in the last resort are the truths of mankind?--They are the irrefutable errors of mankind
For nothing is of greater importance than that a powerful, long-established, and irrational custom should be once again confirmed by the act of some one who is recognized as rational. In this way the proceeding is thought to be sanctioned by reason itself! All honor to your opinions! but little unconventional actions are of still greater value
Zarathustra saw many lands and many peoples: thus he discovered the good and evil of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than good and evil
Almost everything we call "higher culture" is based on the spiritualization of cruelty
24. O sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple!
Where solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where the market-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies
Thus I spoke, and always more softly, for I was afraid of my thoughts, and of the thoughts behind my thoughts. Then, suddenly I heard a dog howl near me
If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get yourselves carried aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people's backs and heads!
He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you
The philosopher seeks to hear within himself the echoes of the world of symphony and to re-project them in the form if concepts
Use caution when hunting monsters, that you do not become one yourself; for when man stares into the abyss, the abyss also stares into him
I see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors!
In disrespecting, we show that we still mantain a sense of respect
. . . there is no being behind doing, effecting, becoming; "the doer" is merely a fiction added to the deed-the deed is everything
In the end one loves one's desire and not what is desired
These smoky, room-temperature, used-up, wilted, fretful souls -how could their grudge endure my happiness? Hence I show them only the ice and the winter of my peaks-and not that my mountain still winds all the belts of the sun round itself. They hear only my winter winds whistling-and not that I also cross warm seas, like longing, heavy, hot south winds. They still have pity on my accidents; but my word says, "Let accidents come to me, they are innocent as little children
If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you
Humanity is still much more a means than an end. It is the type: the human race is merely the test material, the vast excess of failure, a debris field
Binds strongest? What cords seem almost unbreakable? In the case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of duty:
When the Christian Crusaders in the East came into collision with that invincible order of assassins, that order of free spirits par excellence, whose lowest grade lives in a state of discipline such as no order of monks has ever attained, then in some way or other they managed to get an inkling of that symbol and tally- word, that was reserved for the highest grade alone as their secretum, "Nothing is true, everything is allowed," - in sooth, that was freedom of thought, thereby was taking leave of the very belief in truth
The bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as man
The beast lives unhistorically; for it "goes into" the present, like a number, without leaving any curious remainder
They rule, not because they want to, but because they are; they are not at liberty to play second
And often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. And often we attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable
Are the axioms of logic adequate to reality or are they a means and measure for us to create reality, the concept reality, for ourselves?
In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,-that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other
A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much poison at last for a pleasant death
One does not hate as long as one has a low esteem of someone, but only when one esteems him as an equal or a superior
I love him whose soul is lavish, who wants no thanks and does not give back: for he always gives, and desires not to keep for himself
I love him who scatters golden words in advance of his deeds, and always does more than he promises: for he seeks his own down-going
Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference itself as a power, how could you live according to this indifference? Living, is that not precisely wanting to be different? And supposing your imperative âlive according to nature meant at bottom as much as âlive according to life, how could you not do that? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?
Freedoers are at disadvantage compared with freethinkers because people suffer more obviously from the consequences of deeds than from those of thoughts
He who has a why to live can bear almost any how
And just look at these men: their eye saith it - they know nothing better on earth than to be with a woman. Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! If their filth hath spirit in it!
TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil
To leave is to suffer,to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering
Yet nothing can be more certain than this: what makes a poet a poet is the fact that he sees himself surrounded by figures who live and act before him, and into whose innermost essence he gazes. Because of the peculiar weakness of modern talent we are inclined to imagine the original aesthetic phenomenon in too complicated and abstract a manner. For the genuine poet metaphor is no rhetorical figure, but an image which takes the place of something else, something he can really see before him as a substitute for a concept. To the poet a character is not a whole composed of selected single features, but an insistently alive person whom he sees before his very eyes, and distinguished from a painter's vision of the same thing only by the fact that poet sees the figure continuing to live and act over a period of time. What allows Homer to depict things so much more vividly than all other poets? It is the fact that he looks at things so much more than they do. We talk so abstractly about poetry because we are usually all bad poets. Fundamentally the aesthetic phenomenon is simple; one only has to have the ability to watch a living play continuously and to live constantly surrounded by crowds of spirits, then one is a poet; if one feels the impulse to transform oneself and to speak out of other bodies and souls, then one is a dramatist
Examine the lives of the best and more fruitful men and peoples, and ask yourselves whether a tree, if it is to grow proudly into the sky, can do without bad weather and storms: whether unkindness and opposition from without, whether some sort of hatred, envy, obstinacy, mistrust, severity, greed and violence do not belong to the favouring circumstances without which a great increase even in virtue is hardly possible. The poison which destroys the weaker nature strengthens the stronger  and he does not call it poison, either
For the new year -  I still live, I still think: I still have to live, for I still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito, cogito, ergo sum. Today everybody permits himself the expression of his wish and his dearest thought; hence I, too, shall say what it is that I wish from myself today, and what was the first thought to run across my heart this year - what thought shall be for me the reason, warranty, and sweetness of my life henceforth! I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer
Like a stranger and an outcast, I move among them not one of their words or looks reaches me any longer. I am dumb for no one understands my speech ah, but they never did understand me! Or does the same fate bear the same burden on its soul? It is terrible to be condemned to silence when one has so much to say [ ] Was I made for solitude or for a life in which there was no one to whom I could speak? The inability to communicate ones thoughts is in very truth the most terrible of all kinds of loneliness
To live as I incline, or not to live at all: so do I wish; so wisheth also the holiest. But alas! how have I still - inclination?   Have I-still a goal? A haven towards which MY sail is set?  A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth WHITHER he saileth, knoweth what wind is good, and a fair wind for him.  What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; and unstable will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone.  This seeking for MY home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know that this seeking hath been MY home-sickening; it eateth me up
It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn author-and that he did not learn it better
He does not wear a twitching, mobile, human face, but rather a mask, as it were, with its features in dignified equilibrium; he does not shout, nor does he even change his tone of voice. If a veritable storm-cloud empties itself on his head, he wraps himself in his cloak and slowly walks away from under it
It is better to have loved and lost,than never to have loved at all..
Myself regarding the luxury of my truth. Enough, I still live; and life is not
Only a person of deep faith can afford the luxury of skepticism
I myself, to be sure - I have as yet seen no great man. That which is great, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It is the kingdom of the populace
What surprises me most when surveying the great destinies of man is always seeing before me the opposite of what Darwin and his school see or want to see today: selection in favor of the stronger, in favor of those who have come off better, the progress of the species. The very opposite is quite palpably the case: the elimination of the strokes of luck, the uselessness of the better-constituted types, the inevitable domination achieved by the average, even below-average types
And that discovery would betray the closely guarded secret of modern culture to the laughter of the world. For we moderns have nothing of our own. We only become worth notice by filling ourselves to overflowing with foreign customs, arts, philosophies, religions and sciences: we are wandering encyclopaedias, as an ancient Greek who had strayed into our time would probably call us. But the only value of an encyclopaedia lies in the inside, in the contents, not in what is written outside, in the binding or the wrapper. And so the whole of modern culture is essentially internal; the bookbinder prints something like this on the cover: Manual of internal culture for external barbarians. The opposition of inner and outer makes the outer side still more barbarous, as it would naturally be, when the outward growth of a rude people merely developed its primitive inner needs. For what means has nature of repressing too great a luxuriance from without? Only one,-to be affected by it as little as possible, to set it aside and stamp it out at the first opportunity. And so we have the custom of no longer taking real things seriously, we get the feeble personality on which the real and the permanent make so little impression. Men become at last more careless and accommodating in external matters, and the [Pg 34] considerable cleft between substance and form is widened; until they have no longer any feeling for barbarism, if only their memories be kept continually titillated, and there flow a constant stream of new things to be known, that can be neatly packed up in the cupboards of their memory
Truly, you understand the reverse art of alchemy, the depreciating of the most valuable things! Try, just for once, another recipe, in order not to realise as hitherto the opposite of what you mean to attain: deny those good things, withdraw from them the applause of the populace and discourage the spread of them, make them once more the concealed chastities of solitary souls, and say: morality is something forbidden! Perhaps you will thus attract to your cause the sort of men who are only of any account, I mean the heroic. But then there must be something formidable in it, and not as hitherto something disgusting!
I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they do not forgive me for do not envying their virtues. They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small people, small virtues are necessary - and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are necessary!
Why does Homer give us descriptions so much more vivid than all the poets? Because he sees so much more around him. We speak about poetry so abstractly because we all tend to be poor poets. The aesthetic phenomenon is fundamentally simple: if someone simply possesses the capacity to see a living game going on continually and to live all the time surrounded by hordes of ghosts, then the man is a poet; if someone simply feels the urge to change himself and to speak out from other bodies and souls, then that person is a dramatist
CALM is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hides droll monsters! Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkles with swimming enigmas and laughters
Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby has he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph has he overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain
Still am I the richest and most to be envied - I, the lonesomest one!
For the new year. -- I still live, I still think: I still have to live, for I still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum. Today everybody permits himself the expression of his wish and his dearest thought: hence I, too, shall say what it is that I wish from myself today, and what was the first thought to run across my heart this year -- what thought shall be for me the reason, warranty, and sweetness of my life henceforth. I want to learn to see more and more as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all and all and on the whole: someday I wish to be only a Yes-sayer
This is the manner of noble souls: they do not want to have anything for nothing; least of all, life. Whoever is of the mob wants to live for nothing; we others, however, to whom life gave itself, we always think about what we might best give in return. And verily, that is a noble speech which says, What life promises us, we ourselves want to keep to life. One shall not wish to enjoy where one does not give joy. And one shall not wish to enjoy! For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things: both do not want to be sought. One shall possess them  but rather seek even guilt and suffering
The visible action is not the self-manifestation of the inward life, but only a weak and crude attempt of a single thread to make a show of representing the whole
That mountain there! That cloud there! What is 'real' about those? Try taking away the phantasm and the entire human contribution, you sober realists! Yes, if only you could do that! If you could forget your heritage, your past, your training  your entire humanity and animality! For us there is no 'reality'  nor for you either, you sober ones
In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule
Corruption is just a rude word for the autumn of a people
Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes
I call myself the last philosopher, because I am the last man. No one speaks with me but myself, and my voice comes to me like the voice of a dying man! Let me associate for but one hour more with you, dear voice, with you, the last trace of the memory of all human happiness. With you I escape loneliness through self-delusion and lie myself into multiplicity and love. For my heart resists the belief that love is dead. It cannot bear the shudder of the loneliest loneliness, and so it forces me to speak as if I were two
... a thing can only live through a pious illusion
It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of-namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown
Thereby men do not flee from being deceived as much as from being damaged by deception: what they hate at this stage is basically not the deception but the bad, hostile consequences of certain kinds of deceptions. In a similarly limited way man wants the truth: he desires the agreeable life-preserving consequences of truth, but he is indifferent to pure knowledge, which has no consequences; he is even hostile to possibly damaging and destructive truths
My conception of freedom. - The value of a thing sometimes does not lie in that which one attains by it, but in what one pays for it - what it costs us. I give an example. Liberal institutions cease to be liberal as soon as they are attained: later on, there are no worse and no more thorough injurers of freedom than liberal institutions. One knows, indeed, what their ways bring: they undermine the will to power; they level mountain and valley, and call that morality; they make men small, cowardly, and hedonistic [genÃ¼sslich] - every time it is the herd animal that triumphs with them. Liberalism: in other words, herd-animalization
The dignity of folly And just as tyranny of truth and science could increase esteem for the lie, a tyranny of prudence could spur the growth of a new kind of nobility
Accordingly, I do not believe that an "impulse to knowledge" is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument
The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live-that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life
What is done out of love takes place beyond good and evil
For all the value that the true, the truthful, the selfless may deserve, it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness, and lust. It might even be possible that what constitutes the value of these good and revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related, tied to, and involved with these wicked, seemingly opposite things-maybe even one with them in essence. Maybe!
I have thought of you much, and have shared with you in thought much that has been elevating, stirring, and gay, so much so that it has been like living with my dear friends. If only you know how novel and strange that seems to an old hermit like me? How often it has made me laugh at myself!
In wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet. But they misunderstand one another. I know you
The progress of science has been amazingly rapid in the last decade; but consider the savants, those exhausted hens. They are certainly not harmonious natures: they can merely cackle more than before, because they lay eggs oftener: but the eggs are always smaller, [Pg 64] though their books are bigger. The natural result of it all is the favourite popularising of science (or rather its feminising and infantising), the villainous habit of cutting the cloth of science to fit the figure of the general public
As soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima
Which does not kill us makes us stronger
HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness?
That poem was not by me. It is among the things which quite overpower me; I have never been able to read it without tears coming to my eyes; it sounds like a voice for which I have been waiting and waiting since childhood. The poem is by my friend Lou... She is as shrewd as an eagle and brave as a lion, and yet still a very girlish child, who perhaps will not live long
There is something the child sees that he does not see; something the child hears that he does not hear; and this something is the most important thing of all. Because he does not understand it, his understanding is more childish than the child's and more simple than simplicity itself; in spite of the many clever wrinkles on his parchment face, and the masterly play of his fingers in unravelling the knots
The former morality, namely Kants, demanded of the individual actions which one desired of all men: that was a very naive thing;
I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!
Rather the artists delight in what becomes, the cheerfulness of artistic creation that defies all misfortune, is merely a bright image of clouds and sky mirrored in a black lake of sadness
Life consists of rare, isolated moments of the greatest significance, and of innumerably many intervals, during which at best the silhouettes of those moments hover about us. Love, springtime, every beautiful melody, mountains, the moon, the sea  all these speak completely to the heart but once, if in fact they ever do get a chance to speak completely. For many men do not have those moments at all, and are themselves intervals and intermissions in the symphony of real life
What has been the greatest sin here on earth so far? Was it not the word of him who said: âWoe unto those who laugh now!  Did he himself find no grounds on earth for laughter? Then he simply did not look. Even a child can find such grounds here.  He - did not love enough: else he would also have loved us who laugh! But he hated and scorned us: weeping and gnashing of teeth he promised for us.  Must one straightway curse where one does not love? That - seems to me bad taste. But that is what he did, this unconditional man. He came from the mob.  And he himself simply did not love enough: else he would have been less angry that he was not loved. All great love does not want love: - it wants more.  Get out of the way of all such unconditional men! That is a poor sick kind, a mob-kind: they look at life sadly; they have the evil eye for this earth.  Get out of the way of all such unconditional men! They have heavy feet and sultry hearts: - they know not how to dance. So how could the earth be light for such as them!
I love to lose myself for a while
Most books are born from the smoke and vapour of the brain: and to vapour and smoke may they well return. For having no fire within themselves, they shall be visited with fire
Fear is the mother of morality
All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils, angels
Socialism itself can hope to exist only for brief periods here and there, and then only through the exercise of the extremest terrorism. For this reason it is secretly preparing itself for rule through fear and is driving the word justice into the heads of the half-educated masses like a nail so as to rob them of their reason  and to create in them a good conscience for the evil game they are to play
You great star, what would your happiness be had you not those for whom you shine?
As if it were the task of every time to be just to everything before it! Ages and generations have never the right to be the judges of all previous ages and generations: only to the rarest men in them can that difficult mission fall. Who compels you to judge? If it is your wish-you must prove first that you are capable of justice. As judges, you must stand higher than that which is to be judged: as it is, you have only come later. The guests that come last to the table should rightly take the last places: and will you take the first? Then do some great and mighty deed: the place may be prepared for you then, even though you do come last
The solitary speaks."One receives as a reward for much ennui , ill-humour and boredom, such as a solitude without friends, books, duties or passions must entail, one harvests those quarters of an hour of the deepest immersion in oneself and nature. He who completely entrenches himself against boredom also entrenches himself against himself: he will never get to drink the most potent refreshing draught from the deepest well of his own being
Love your enemies because they bring out the best in you
One! O man! Take heed! Two! What says deep midnight's voice indeed? Three! "I slept my sleep- Four! "From deepest dream I've woke and plead:- Five! "The world is deep, Six! "And deeper than the day could read. Seven! "Deep is its woe- Eight! "Joy- deeper still than grief can be: Nine! "Woe says: Hence! Go! Ten! "But joys all want eternity- Eleven! "Want deep profound eternity!" Twelve!
I am of today and of the has-been (he said then); but there is something in me that is of tomorrow and of the day-after-tomorrow and of the shall-be
The discerning one walketh amongst men as amongst animals
Valuating is itself the value and jewel of all valued things
That the other suffers has to be learned; and it can never be learned fully
And again, there are those who sit in their swamp and speak thus from the rushes: 'Virtue - that means to sit quietly in the swamp. We bite nobody and avoid him who wants to bite: and in everything we hold the opinion that is given us
The workers of Europe ought to henceforth declare themselves as a class a human impossibility... they ought to inaugurate within the European beehive an age of a great swarming-out such as has never been seen before
Some of them will, but most of them are willed. Some of them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors
Precisely the least thing, the gentlest, lightest, the rustling of a lizard, a breath, a moment, a twinkling of the eye - little makes up the quality of the best happiness. Soft!
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also his friends
We are unknown, we knowers, to ourselves   Of necessity we remain strangers to ourselves, we understand ourselves not, in our selves we are bound to be mistaken, for each of us holds good to all eternity the motto, âEach is the farthest away from himself-as far as ourselves are concerned we are not knowers
The knight of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends
Have you understood me? Dionysus versus Christ
Yes, I recognize Zarathustra. His eyes are clear now, no longer does he sneer with loathing. Just see how he dances along!
He who is dissatisfied with himself is continually ready for revenge and we others will be his victims, if only in having always to endure his ugly sight. For the sight of the ugly makes one bad and gloomy
Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me, makes me stronger
The feeling of rank is one of the most basic human instincts. To gossip about someone is to elevate yourself above him or her
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to  hate his friends
We have already gone beyond whatever we have words for
One not only wants to be understood when one writes, but also quite as certainly not to be understood.  It is by no means an objection to a book when someone finds it unintelligible: perhaps this might just have been the intention of its author, perhaps he did not want to be understood by "anyone.  A distinguished intellect and taste, when it wants to communicate its thoughts, always selects its hearers; by selecting them, it at the same time closes its barriers against "the others".  It is there that all the more refined laws of style have their origin: they at the same time keep off, they create distance, they prevent "access" (intelligibility, as we have said,) while they open the ears of those who are acoustically related to them
Throw roses into the abyss and say: âhere is my thanks to the monster who didn't succeed in swallowing me alive
The poison from which the weaker nature perishes strengthens the strong man - and he does not call it poison
The abdomen is the reason why man does not easily take himself for a god
One in three all friends are: Brothers in distress, equals facing rivals, free men - facing death!
To be sure, it takes a stronger gaze and a better will to further that which is evolving and imperfect, rather than to penetrate its imperfection and reject it
Reaction against the machine-culture. - The machine, itself a product of the highest intellectual energies, sets in motion in those who server it almost nothing but the lower, non-intellectual energies. It thereby releases a vast quantity of energy in general that would otherwise lie dormant, it is true; but it provides no instigation to enhancement, to improvement, to becoming an artist. It makes men active and uniform - but in the long run this engenders a counter-effect, a despairing boredom of soul, which teaches to long for idleness in all it varieties
They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is unlearning to fear man: but the woman who "unlearns to fear" sacrifices her most womanly instincts
It was subtle of God to learn Greek when he wished to become an author - and not to learn it better
As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without jealously ; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty
The Good Man Better an enmity from one block than friendship held together by glue
What does man actually know about himself? Is he, indeed, ever able to perceive himself completely, as if laid out in a lighted display case? Does nature not conceal most things from him - even concerning his own body - in order to confine and lock him within a proud, deceptive consciousness, aloof from the coils of the bowels, the rapid flow of the blood stream, and the intricate quivering of the fibers! She threw away the key
Man is a rope stretched between beast and Overman - a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous shuddering and stopping. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what is lovable in man is that he is an overture and a going-under
A man's stomach is the reason he does not easily take himself for a God
The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily!
A: So you intend to return to your desert?  B: I am not quick moving. I have to wait for myself- it is always late before the water comes to light out of the well of my self, and I often have to endure thirst for longer than I have patience. That is why I go into solitude- so as not to drink out of everybodys cistern. When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think as I really think; after a time it always seems as though they want to banish me from myself and rob me of my soul- and I grow angry with everybody and fear everybody. I then require the desert, so as to grow good again
He enters a labyrinth, he multiplies by a thousand the dangers already inherent in the very act of living, not the least of which is the fact that no one with eyes will see how and where he gets lost and lonely and is torn limb from limb by some cave-Minotaur of conscience
Against fantasists.- The fantasist denies reality to himself, the liar does so only to others
Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!
Battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster and if you gaze into the abyss the abyss gazes into you
Today we read of Don Quixote with a bitter taste in the mouth, it is almost an ordeal, which would make us seem very strange and incomprehensible to the author and his contemporaries,  they read it with a clear conscience as the funniest of books, it made them nearly laugh themselves to death).To see suffering does you good, to make suffer, better still  that On the Genealogy of Morality 42 48 See below, Supplementary material, pp. 1534. 49 See below, Supplementary material, pp. 1379, pp. 1401, pp. 1434. 50 Don Quixote, Book II, chs 317. is a hard proposition, but an ancient, powerful, human-all-too-human proposition to which, by the way, even the apes might subscribe: as people say, in thinking up bizarre cruelties they anticipate and, as it were, act out a âdemonstration of what man will do. No cruelty, no feast: that is what the oldest and longest period in human history teaches us  and punishment, too, has such very strong festive aspects!
I caught this insight on the way and quickly seized the rather poor words that were closest to hand to pin it down lest it fly away again. And now it has died of these arid words and shakes and flaps in them-- and I hardly know anymore when I look at it how I could ever have felt so happy when I caught this bird
Do you believe then that the sciences would ever have arisen and become great if there had not beforehand been magicians, alchemists, astrologers and wizards, who thirsted and hungered after abscondite and forbidden powers?
One must learn to love oneself- thus do I teach- with a wholesome and healthy love: that one may endure to be with oneself, and not go roving about
From which stars have we fallen to meet each other here
Preparatory human beings. - I welcome all signs that a more virile, warlike age is about to begin, which will restore honor to courage above all! For this age shall prepare the way for one yet higher, and it shall gather the strength that this higher age will require some day - the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and that will wage wars for the sake of ideas and their consequences
If you still experience the stars as something "over you," you still don't have the eyes of a knower
This however is my teaching: he who wishes one day to fly, must first learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing:- one does not fly into flying!
It is not enough to prove something, one has also to seduce or elevate people to it. That is why the man of knowledge should learn how to speak his wisdom: and often in such a way that it sounds like folly!
In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality
There are on the earth many good inventions, some useful, some pleasant: for their sake is the earth to be loved. And many such good inventions are there, that they are like woman's breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant
And those who were seen dancing  were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
...To become what one is, one must not have the faintest notion what one is
Science" as a prejudice.-It follows from the laws of order of rankle that scholars, insofar as they belong to the spiritual middle class, can never catch sight of the really great problems and question marks; moreover, their courage and their eyes simply do not reach that far-and above all, their needs which led them to become scholars in the first place, their inmost assumptions and desires that things might be such and such, their fears and hopes all come to rest and are satisfied too soon. Take, for example, that pedantic Englishman, Herbert Spencer. What makes him "enthuse" in his way and then leads him to draw a line of hope, a horizon of desirability-that eventual reconciliation of "egoism and altruism" about which he raves-almost nauseates the likes of us; a human race that adopted such Spencerian perspectives as its ultimate perspectives would seem to us worthy of contempt, of annihilation!
Unconditional love also includes-the ardent desire to be abused: at that point it is a defiance directed against itself, and out of its devotion the very wish for self-annihilation finally arises: "Drown in this sea!
This- is now my way,- where is yours?" Thus did I answer those who asked me "the way." For the way- it does not exist!
On account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not jealous, thou lover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one
Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us?
Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him
Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones, but by contrary extreme positions
...there is no "being" behind doing, effecting, becoming; "the doer" is merely a fiction added to the deed-the deed is everything
The liar is a person who uses the valid designations, the words, in order to make something which is unreal appear to be real. He says, for example, "I am rich," when the proper designation for his condition would be "poor." He misuses fixed conventions by means of arbitrary substitutions or even reversals of names. If he does this in a selfish and moreover harmful manner, society will cease to trust him and will thereby exclude him. What men avoid by excluding the liar is not so much being defrauded as it is being harmed by means of fraud. Thus, even at this stage, what they hate is basically not deception itself, but rather the unpleasant, hated consequences of certain sorts of deception. It is in a similarly restricted sense that man now wants nothing but truth: he desires the pleasant, life-preserving consequences of truth. He is indifferent toward pure knowledge which has no consequences; toward those truths which are possibly harmful and destructive he is even hostilely inclined
It is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with the truth at all
When we observe how some people know how to manage their experiences--their insignificant, everyday experiences--so that they become an arable soil that bears fruit three times a year, while others--and how many there are!--are driven through surging waves of destiny, the most multifarious currents of the times and the nations, and yet always remain on top, bobbing like a cork, then we are in the end tempted to divide mankind into a minority (a minimality) of those who know how to make much of little, and a majority of those who know how to make little of much
Let the youthful soul look back on life with the question: what have you truly loved up to now, what has elevated your soul, what has mastered it and at the same time delighted it? Place these venerated objects before you in a row, and perhaps they will yield for you, through their nature and their sequence, a law, the fundamental law of your true self. Compare these objects, see how one complements, expands, surpasses, transfigures another, how they form a stepladder upon which you have climbed up to yourself as you are now; for your true nature lies, not hidden deep within you, but immeasurably high above you, or at least above that which you normally take to be yourself
I beg of you my brothers, remain true to the earth, believe not those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poisoners are they
An idealist is incorrigible: if he is thrown out of his heaven he makes an ideal of his hell. Let him be disillusioned and behold!-he will embrace this disillusionment just as fervently as a little while before he embraced his hopes. Insofar as his tendency is among the great incurable tendencies of human nature he is able to give rise to tragic destinies and afterwards become the subject of tragedies: for tragedies have to do with precisely what is incurable, ineluctable, inescapable in the fate and character of man
When death brings at last the desired forgetfulness, it abolishes life and being together, and sets the seal on the knowledge that "being" is merely a continual "has been," a thing that lives by denying and destroying and contradicting itself
If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
Ah, give me madness, you heavenly powers! Madness, that I may at least believe in myself! Give deliriums and convulsions, sudden lights and darkness, terrify me with frost and fire such as no mortal has ever felt, with deafening din and prowling figures, make me howl and whine and crawl like a beast: so that I may only come to believe in myself!
We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving
This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race.... And mankind reckons time from the dies nefastus when this fatality befell--from the first day of Christianity!--Why not rather from its last?--From today?--The transvaluation of all values!..
I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may perish through a small matter: thus he goes willingly over the bridge
It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures:
Take care not to spit against the wind!
Morality is a fiction used by a herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior ones..!!
A thing can only live through a pious illusion
Error regarding life necessary to life. - Every belief in the value and dignity of life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through the fact that empathy with the universal life and suffering of mankind is very feebly developed in the individual. Even those rarer men who think beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the value of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure life without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the individual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as humanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is capable of such a feeling? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know how to console themselves
The creator wished to look away from himself,--thereupon he created the world
The power of gradually losing all feeling of strangeness or astonishment, and finally being pleased at anything, is called the historical sense or historical culture
God is dood! God blijft dood! En wij hebben hem vermoord!
Not that you lied to me but that I no longer believe you has shaken me
In the end it must be as it is and always has been: great things remain for the great, abysses for the profound, nuances and shudders for the refined, and, in brief, all that is rare for the rare
Toma cuidado!... Ele estÃ¡ a reflectir: vai defender a sua mentira
He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself
Everyone wants the same; everyone is the same; he who has other sentiments goes voluntarily into the madhouse
Do whatever you will, but first be such as are able to will
When a man has been highly honored and has eaten a little he is most benevolent
I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage
He that feeds the hungry refreshes his own soul, says wisdom
Though I may seem at times somewhat distant from you, through the gray mist of philology, I am never far, my thoughts always circle around you
... all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics, the need for perspective and for error..
Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you
Human society: it is an attempt-so I teach-a long seeking: it seeketh however the ruler!- -An attempt, my brethren! And NO "contract"! Destroy, I pray you, destroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and-half!
But the higher you climb, the smaller you appear to the eye of envy. And he who flies is hated most of all
It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we are wont to love
When the gratitude that many owe to one discards all modesty, then there is fame
And to me also, who appreciates life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them, seem to know most about happiness
The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a man, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when they spake of great men - and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed cripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one thing
If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so. But the wind, which we do not see, troubles and bends it as it lists. We are worst bent and troubled by invisible hands
Of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk
Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins. We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have heard only of the obligation imposed by society that it should exist: to be truthful means using the customary metaphors-in moral terms: the obligation to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory for all. . .
I started to investigate and unearth an old faith which for thousands of years we philosophers used to build on as the safest of all foundations-which we built on again and again although every previous structure fell in: I began to undermine our faith in morals . But ye do not understand me?-
To what extent the machine abases us. - The machine is impersonal, it deprives the piece of work of its pride, of the individual goodness and faultiness that adheres to all work done by a machine - that is to say, of its little bit of humanity. In earlier times all purchasing from artisans was a bestowing of a distinction on individuals, and the things with which we surrounded ourselves were  the insignia of these distinctions: household furniture and clothing thus became symbols of mutual esteem and personal solidarity, whereas we now seem to live in the midst of nothing but anonymous and impersonal slavery. - We must not purchase the alleviation of work at too high price
But by my love and hope I beseech you: do not throw away the hero in your soul! Keep sacred your highest hope!
Smooth ice is paradise for those who dance with expertise
I love him who justifies the future ones, and redeems the past ones: for he is willing to perish through the present ones
And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least its warriors. They are the companions and precursors of such saints
Even your silence wants to choke me, you who are so abysmally silent
Oh! Your poverty, ye men, and your sordidness of soul! As much as ye give to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have become poorer thereby.  There is comradeship: may there be friendship!
Here and there on earth there is probably a kind of continuation of love; in which this greedy desire of two people for each other gives way to a new desire and greed, a shared higher thirst for an ideal above them.  But who knows such love? who has experienced it?  Its true name is friendship
Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths
We âconserve nothing; neither do we want to return to any past; we are by no means âliberal; we are not working for âprogress; we dont need to plug our ears to the marketplaces sirens of the future: what they sing  âequal rights, âfree society, âno more masters and no servants  has no allure for us
Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you
What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal
It is often enough, and always with great surprise, intimated to me that there is something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings, from the "Birth of Tragedy" to the recently published "Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future": they all contain, I have been told,
We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh
Every church is a stone on the grave of a god-man: it does not want him to rise up again under any circumstances
Let us face ourselves. We are Hyperboreans!
Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves good because they have crippled paws!
The wasteland grows
Populace above, populace below! What are "poor" and "rich"..
From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth -- her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance of beauty
Pitch-black winter nights live in my bones
It goes to reason if you always on the reasons go
Those who commend work. - In the glorification of 'work', in the unwearied talk of the 'blessing of work', I see the same covert idea as in the praise of useful impersonal actions: that of fear of everything individual. Fundamentally, one now feels at the sight of work - one always means by work that hard industriousness from early till late - that such work is the best policeman, that it keeps everyone in bounds and can mightily hinder the development of reason, covetousness, desire for independence. For it uses up an extraordinary amount of nervous energy, which is thus denied to reflection, brooding, dreaming, worrying, loving, hating; it sets a small goal always in sight and guarantees easy and regular satisfactions. Thus a society in which there is continual hard work will have more security: and security is now worshipped as the supreme divinity. - And now! Horror! Precisely the 'worker' has become dangerous! The place is swarming with 'dangerous individuals'! And behind them the danger of dangers - the individual!
